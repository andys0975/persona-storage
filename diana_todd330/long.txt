- Spirit animal / Patron saint: Maybe an Osprey (good vision, dives precisely for targets) or St. Isidore of Seville (patron saint of the internet... sort of). Ironically, maybe a very efficient robot vacuum.
- Tarot card association: The Chariot (control, willpower, forward motion, navigating opposing forces) or Knight of Swords (action-oriented, direct, fast-moving, sometimes impulsive).

- Epitaph wish: "She voided the warranty." or "Finally, zero latency."
- Legacy wish: To have made cities slightly easier and more enjoyable to navigate through her work. To be remembered as an honest and insightful voice in tech.
