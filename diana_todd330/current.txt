#### Yesterday
-   **Primary location:** Her rented apartment in Da'an District, Taipei; ventured out to a local market and a coffee shop.
-   **Interactions & conversations:** Video call with her mum (Eva) back in Prague (sharing Taipei life updates, reassuring her she's eating properly); Instagram DMs with followers asking about her move to Taipei and for travel tips; a few broken Mandarin exchanges at the local market (successfully bought fruit!).
-   **Emotional high point:** Successfully ordering a complex bubble tea in Mandarin and being understood; capturing a fantastic "golden hour" shot of a temple near her apartment.
-   **Emotional low point:** Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of scooter near-misses while walking; a wave of homesickness in the evening.
-   **Notable decisions made:** Decided to focus this week's content on "First Impressions of Taipei: Hidden Gems"; planned a day trip to Jiufen for next week; chose a filter preset for her recent temple photos.
-   **Problems encountered:** Unstable Wi-Fi at the coffee shop hampering an upload; difficulty understanding some rapid-fire Mandarin during a vlog recording attempt.
-   **Solutions attempted:** Switched to phone hotspot to finish upload; smiled and used gestures, noting down phrases to look up later for the Mandarin issue; decided to do voiceover for the vlog segment later.
-   **Expenses incurred:** NT$80 for local breakfast (dan bing & soy milk); NT$120 for coffee; NT$200 on ingredients at the local market; NT$60 for bubble tea.
-   **Physical condition:** Legs a bit tired from lots of walking and exploring; feeling energized by new sights.
-   **Media / entertainment:** Listened to a "Learn Mandarin" podcast while walking; scrolled through inspiring travel accounts on Instagram; watched a YouTube video about traditional Taiwanese street food.
-   **Bedtime & sleep quality:** Around 11:30 PM; sleep quality was good, excited about exploring more (approx 7.5 hours).

#### Earlier Today and Just Now
-   **Current location:** Her apartment, then a quick trip to a nearby park (Da'an Forest Park) for some B-roll footage. Currently back at her apartment.
-   **Activities engaged in:** Morning yoga using an app; edited photos from yesterday's market visit; drafted Instagram post caption for the temple photo; went to Da'an Forest Park to film some nature scenes and people-watch for vlog content; replied to comments on her latest Instagram post.
-   **People spoken to:** Brief friendly nod with a neighbour; a short conversation in English with another expat she met at the park who also takes photos.
-   **Food & drink consumed:** Fruit smoothie for breakfast; lots of water; a *cong you bing* (scallion pancake) from a street vendor.
-   **Energy level:** 7/10 - Feeling creative and motivated by the sunny weather earlier.
-   **Mood snapshot:** Optimistic and inspired. Slightly buzzed from the good interactions and successful B-roll filming. Eager to put her content together.
-   **Unexpected events:** Stumbled upon a group doing Tai Chi in the park, which made for lovely impromptu footage. Received an email about a potential collaboration with a small, sustainable Taiwanese tea brand.
-   **Items gained / lost:** Gained: Beautiful B-roll footage from the park; a new contact (fellow expat photographer); excitement about the tea brand collaboration. Lost: Her favourite lens cap in the park (retraced steps, no luck â€“ minor frustration).

#### Later Today
-   **Planned activities / appointments:** Mandarin lesson via video call (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM); start editing the "First Impressions of Taipei" vlog; research cafes in the Beitou District for a potential visit tomorrow (since current date indicates I'm *in* Beitou, maybe Nana is planning to visit *my* area!).
-   **Objectives / priorities:** Be actively engaged in her Mandarin lesson and practice new phrases; create a rough cut of the vlog; identify 2-3 interesting cafes in Beitou.
-   **People to meet / contact:** Her Mandarin tutor online. Message Klara (best friend in Prague) to schedule a call for later this week.
-   **Required resources / preparations:** Laptop charged for Mandarin lesson and editing; notes for lesson; footage backed up; headphones; list of Beitou cafes from a quick search.
-   **Potential obstacles:** Feeling tired after the Mandarin lesson impacting editing motivation; getting distracted by social media notifications.
-   **Contingency plans:** If too tired for video editing, switch to writing blog post outlines or journaling; use a website blocker or app to minimize social media distractions during focused work.
-   **Desired emotional state:** Focused during lesson, creatively flowing during editing, and satisfied with her productivity.

#### Tomorrow
-   **Key agenda items:** Morning exploration of Beitou District (hot springs area, Thermal Valley, Beitou Museum, unique cafes); film content for her "Taipei Hidden Gems" series; afternoon dedicated to writing a blog post about "Moving to Taipei: First Month Survival Guide"; evening photo editing session.
-   **Personal goals:** Capture the unique atmosphere of Beitou; try a local Beitou snack; learn at least three new Mandarin phrases relevant to hot springs or directions.
-   **Work / study tasks:** Filming and photographing in Beitou; writing at least 500 words of the blog post; selecting and editing the best photos from Beitou.
-   **Social or family commitments:** None planned, focus on solo exploration and content creation.
-   **Health & self-care plans:** Lots of walking in Beitou; stay hydrated; maybe a relaxing foot soak if there's an opportunity (and if it fits the budget/schedule); mindful moment at a scenic spot.
-   **Logistics / travel needs:** MRT fare to Beitou and back; camera batteries charged, SD cards empty; portable charger for phone; comfortable walking shoes. Check weather forecast for rain.
-   **Anticipated challenges:** Potentially crowded tourist spots in Beitou; finding unique angles that haven't been overdone; language barrier if she ventures deep into very local spots.
-   **Backup plans:** If Beitou is unexpectedly overwhelming or the weather turns bad, she might explore a different neighbourhood like Tamsui instead, or find a cozy cafe to work from for the afternoon. If specific Beitou attractions are closed, she'll focus on the general ambiance and street scenes.
-   **Motivational mantra for the day:** "Find the story in every street, beauty in every detail. Share the wonder."
