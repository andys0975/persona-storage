#### Yesterday
-   Primary location: Home office/studio apartment in Taipei.
-   Interactions & conversations: Slack messages with editor regarding minor feedback on scheduled gadget videos; email exchange with potential collaborator discussing initial ideas; brief frustrated texts with Kai about coding roadblocks.
-   Emotional high point: Briefly getting past a minor bug in the Python script after hours of debugging.
-   Emotional low point: Realizing the YouBike API authentication issue is more complex than initially thought, leading to significant frustration.
-   Notable decisions made: Decided to pause YouBike API work for the evening and switch to editing helmet footage to avoid burnout; scheduled a backup indoor filming slot for the helmet review due to uncertain weather forecast.
-   Problems encountered: Persistent YouBike API authentication error; intermittent rain preventing outdoor B-roll filming for the helmet.
-   Solutions attempted: Tried multiple authentication methods for the API based on online documentation and forums (unsuccessful); focused on indoor product shots and editing for the helmet review instead of outdoor filming.
-   Expenses incurred: NT$150 on bubble tea delivery (stress coping); NT$300 on takeout dinner.
-   Physical condition: Slight eye strain from screen time; neck tension from editing posture. Felt mentally drained from coding attempts.
-   Media / entertainment: Listened to a tech podcast while editing; watched a couple of YouTube videos on Python API authentication.
-   Bedtime & sleep quality: Around 1:30 AM; sleep quality was average, restless due to coding problem lingering in mind (approx 6 hours).

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
-   Current location: Home office/studio apartment.
-   Activities engaged in: Responded to emails (including follow-up on sponsor negotiation status); reviewed weather forecast (still rainy); worked on scripting the 'Winter Cycling Gear' video outline; attempted another short session on the YouBike API problem (no breakthrough).
-   People spoken to: None verbally; email communication only.
-   Food & drink consumed: Coffee (x2); toast with peanut butter; water.
-   Energy level: 6/10 - Started okay, dipped slightly during the API attempt.
-   Mood snapshot: Focused but slightly apprehensive about the weather impacting weekend plans and filming schedule. Underlying determination mixed with coding fatigue.
-   Unexpected events: Received an automated alert about a YouTube comment policy update requiring review.
-   Items gained / lost: Gained: Clarity on the winter gear video structure. Lost: More time to the API issue.

#### Later Today (upcoming)
-   Planned activities / appointments: Film indoor segments for the commuter helmet review (close-ups, feature explanations); prepare gear for potential outdoor ride tomorrow; dedicate a focused evening block to editing the helmet footage.
-   Objectives / priorities: Complete all planned indoor shots for the helmet; make significant progress on the helmet review edit; finalize gear list for tomorrow's ride.
-   People to meet / contact: Send a quick check-in message to Kai about weekend brunch plans.
-   Required resources / preparations: Charged camera batteries, cleared SD cards, set up lighting for indoor filming, Final Cut Pro project ready for editing.
-   Potential obstacles: Getting distracted during editing (ADHD); feeling unmotivated if API issue lingers mentally; unexpected equipment malfunction.
-   Contingency plans: If editing focus wanes, switch to organizing footage or planning shots for the cargo bike review; use Pomodoro technique for editing sprints.
-   Desired emotional state: Focused, productive, creatively engaged.

#### Tomorrow
-   Date: [Assuming Today is Friday, Tomorrow is Saturday - Insert Date]
-   Key agenda items: Long cycling ride (weather permitting) to test winter gear / helmet features; brunch with Kai; potentially visit Guang Hua Digital Plaza; editing/coding session in the afternoon/evening.
-   Personal goals: Get meaningful real-world test data/footage for the helmet/gear; have a relaxing and recharging brunch with Kai; avoid impulse purchases at Guang Hua.
-   Work / study tasks: Editing helmet review footage; potentially working on the YouBike script if feeling motivated or stuck on editing.
-   Social or family commitments: Brunch with Kai.
-   Health & self-care plans: Long bike ride for physical and mental health; ensure adequate hydration; stick to planned sleep schedule tonight.
-   Logistics / travel needs: Check weather forecast again in the morning; plan cycling route; MRT fare for travel to brunch/Guang Hua.
-   Anticipated challenges: Rain canceling the ride; getting overwhelmed by choices/crowds at Guang Hua; difficulty switching between social mode and work mode.
-   Backup plans: If ride is canceled due to rain: Indoor trainer session, visit a specific tech store instead of browsing Guang Hua, dedicate more time to editing/coding, or reschedule ride for Sunday.
-   Motivational mantra for the day: "Balance is key: Push the pedals, enjoy the company, focus the mind."
