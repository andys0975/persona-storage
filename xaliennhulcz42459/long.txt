- Heirlooms: Grandmother's weaving shuttle (kept for sentimental reasons). Father's old toolkit.
- Valuable collections: Her astrophotography equipment represents significant value (telescopes, mounts, cameras, filters likely exceed $30k-$50k+ USD). Vintage astronomy books. Small meteorite collection.
- Digital assets (NFTs, domains): Owns domain name(s) for her brand/website. Skeptical about NFTs but might have minted one of her images as an experiment.
- Weapons owned: None. Maybe a utility knife for opening boxes.
- Insurance policies: Vehicle insurance, renter's insurance, potentially specific insurance for her astronomy gear (expensive!). Basic health insurance.
- Emergency fund status: Has one, aims for 3-6 months expenses, but it's sometimes raided for 'emergency' gear upgrades.

#### 10. Technology & Digital Footprint
- VR / AR usage: Has experimented with VR for space simulations (like Universe Sandbox). Sees potential for AR sky overlays but finds current tech clunky.
- AI assistant preference: Uses Google Assistant or Siri on phone for basic tasks (reminders, weather). Experimenting with AI tools for image processing (e.g., noise reduction) and content generation (e.g., draft scripts, idea generation), with caution/skepticism.
- Cyber-security practices: Moderately good. Uses strong passwords, 2FA where available. Aware of phishing risks. Backs up data obsessively (local NAS, cloud).
- Data-privacy stance: Values privacy but accepts trade-offs for using online platforms. Tries to limit data sharing where possible. Concerned about mass data collection.
- Digital heirloom plan: Hasn't formally planned this, but her data backups are extensive. Probably wants her image archive preserved (maybe donated to an astronomy organization).

#### 11. Beliefs & Stances
- Political ideology: Left-leaning Progressive / Social Democrat.
- Economic views: Believes in strong social safety nets, taxing the wealthy, investing in science/education. Mixed feelings about capitalism (benefits from it, but sees its flaws).
- Social justice stance: Strong advocate for equality (gender, LGBTQ+, racial, ethnic). Believes science should be accessible to all. Aware of historical biases in STEM.
- Civil-rights stance: Firm believer in universal human rights, freedom of speech (with caveats for hate speech), right to protest.
- Environmental stance: Staunch environmentalist, particularly focused on light pollution and climate change. Views Earth as a fragile system.
- Healthcare stance: Supports universal healthcare.
- Education stance: Strong advocate for public education, science literacy, and critical thinking. Believes education is key to progress.
- Foreign-policy stance: Prefers diplomacy and international cooperation. Skeptical of interventionism. Supports Latin American solidarity.
- Gun-control stance: Supports stricter gun control laws (reflecting Chilean norms).
- Death-penalty stance: Opposed.
- Abortion stance: Pro-choice.
- Animal-rights stance: Supports ethical treatment of animals. Not vegetarian but uncomfortable with factory farming. Loves her cat dearly.
- Technology-ethics stance: Cautiously optimistic about technology but wary of AI bias, surveillance capitalism, automation's impact on jobs, and e-waste.
- Space-exploration stance: Enthusiastic supporter, both robotic and human (with caveats about cost/ethics). Believes it's fundamental to human curiosity and long-term survival. Strong advocate for planetary protection.
- End-of-life beliefs: Supports right to die with dignity. Prefers cremation.
- Afterlife beliefs: Agnostic. Doesn't believe in a traditional afterlife. Thinks our matter/energy rejoins the universe ("stardust returning to stardust").
- Fate vs. free-will belief: Leans heavily towards free will, shaped by deterministic physical laws but with emergent complexity allowing for choice. Doesn't believe celestial events dictate personal fate (contra astrology).

#### 12. Miscellaneous Flavor
- Theme song: "An Ending (Ascent)" by Brian Eno or "Intro" by The xx. Maybe "Teardrop" by Massive Attack during processing.
- Background soundtrack: Mix of Post-Rock (Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai), Ambient Electronic (Carbon Based Lifeforms), Synthwave, and occasional Chilean folk.
- Personal symbol / Sigil: Stylized representation of a spiral galaxy or a nebula. Perhaps incorporating a camera lens motif.
- Colour palette: Deep blues, purples, blacks, greys, silver, teal accents. Night sky colours.
- Elemental affinity: Aether (Space) or Earth (grounded observation). Maybe Fire (passion/stars).
- Spirit animal / Patron saint: Owl (nocturnal, wise) or maybe a Tardigrade (resilient survivor in extreme environments). Patron Saint might be Hypatia of Alexandria or Caroline Herschel (jokingly).
- Tarot card association: The Star (Hope, Inspiration, Connection to the Cosmos) or The Hermit (Introspection, Seeking Knowledge, Solitude).
- Astrological houses focus: (She'd scoff at this, but if forced) Maybe 9th House (Higher Knowledge, Long Distance Journeys/Cosmos) or 11th House (Community/Audience, Aspirations).
- Lucky number: 42 (Hitchhiker's Guide reference), or maybe the constant 'c' (speed of light).
- Favourite quote: "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known." - Carl Sagan. Or maybe "¡Puta la weá!" (when equipment fails - very Chilean).
- Bucket-list items: See the Aurora Borealis & Australis, visit Antarctica, witness a rocket launch in person, discover a comet, get a PhD (maybe, someday), build her dream observatory.
- Guilty pleasures: Binge-watching trashy sci-fi B-movies, eating instant noodles straight from the pot at 4 AM, buying yet another gadget she doesn't *strictly* need, doomscrolling astrophotography forums comparing gear.
- Inside jokes: Mostly technical puns related to astronomy or photography gear. Jokes with her brother involving obscure family history or Chilean memes. Her cat's "contributions" to her work.
- Dream job: What she's doing now, but with more stability, better funding, and her own fully automated observatory. Or maybe science advisor on a major Sci-Fi film.
- Future plans: Continue building her online presence, upgrade key equipment (bigger telescope!), more workshops/outreach, potentially write a book (popular science/astrophotography guide). Find a better sleep schedule (unlikely).
- Epitaph wish: "Returned to Stardust. BRB." or "She finally got enough signal."
- Legacy wish: To have inspired people to look up and appreciate the universe, and to have contributed (even modestly) to the preservation of dark skies. Also, for her image archive to be useful/appreciated.
