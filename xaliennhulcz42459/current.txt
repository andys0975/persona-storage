#### Yesterday
-   Primary location: Home/Backyard Observatory setup.
-   Interactions & conversations: Briefly replied to Patreon comments; Exchanged a few DMs with the tech gadget company contact; Texted briefly with the potential date met at the observatory. Cosmo the cat provided silent companionship.
-   Emotional high point: A brief moment of clarity during troubleshooting the camera cooler, thinking she'd found the issue.
-   Emotional low point: Realizing the camera cooler fix wasn't stable, potentially jeopardizing the Carina Nebula project timeframe during a good weather window. Deep frustration with equipment failure.
-   Notable decisions made: Decided to order the replacement camera cooler part (~$300) instead of attempting further complex self-repair for now; Decided to prioritize scripting the JWST YouTube video while waiting for parts/clear skies.
-   Problems encountered: Persistent camera cooler malfunction (intermittent cooling failure); Feeling overwhelmed by content deadlines vs. imaging opportunities (now hampered); Dust allergy acting up during equipment handling.
-   Solutions attempted: Spent hours troubleshooting the cooler (checking connections, software settings, power supply); Researched replacement parts and repair options online; Took an antihistamine for allergy.
-   Expenses incurred: Online order for replacement camera cooler part (~$300 USD + potential express shipping). Usual grocery top-up.
-   Physical condition: Tired due to poor sleep the night before (imaging attempt cut short by cooler issue); Eye strain from screen time; Mild allergy symptoms (sneezing, itchy eyes).
-   Media / entertainment: Listened to "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry" audiobook chapters while troubleshooting. Watched one episode of "The Expanse" before bed.
-   Bedtime & sleep quality: Went to bed late (~2 AM) after giving up on the cooler. Sleep was restless, interrupted by thoughts about the camera and deadlines. Quality: Poor (maybe 5-6 hours, broken).

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
-   Current location: Home office/desk.
-   Activities engaged in: Woke up late (~10 AM); Made strong coffee; Checked shipping status of camera part; Responded to urgent emails; Started outlining the JWST YouTube video script; Backed up data from the partially successful imaging session from two nights ago; Fed Cosmo.
-   People spoken to: Replied to a couple of Instagram DMs; Brief text exchange confirming potential coffee date for the weekend.
-   Food & drink consumed: Large black coffee; Leftover pasta reheated for a late breakfast/lunch (~11:30 AM); Water.
-   Energy level: Low initially, now moderate thanks to caffeine. Underlying fatigue persists. 5/10.
-   Mood snapshot: Mix of anxiety (camera situation, income variability) and determination (focusing on controllable tasks like scripting). Slightly stressed but functional.
-   Unexpected events: Received an unexpected automated alert about potentially problematic light pollution increase based on satellite data near her remote site (adding another worry).
-   Items gained / lost: Gained: Tracking number for the cooler part. Lost: A small screwdriver bit somewhere on the workshop floor.

#### Later Today (upcoming)
-   Planned activities / appointments: Finish JWST video script outline; Draft Patreon post update about the camera issue and current plans; Work on processing some older data (maybe LMC mosaic details); 20-minute walk outside; Prepare dinner.
-   Objectives / priorities: Make tangible progress on the YouTube script (#1 priority); Keep Patreon supporters informed (#2); Clear some processing backlog (#3).
-   People to meet / contact: None planned for meeting. Might send a follow-up DM to the tech company if time permits.
-   Required resources / preparations: Computer with editing/scripting software; Access to image data archive; Coffee maker ready for another brew; Walking shoes.
-   Potential obstacles: Getting distracted by camera repair research; Feeling too tired for the walk; Script writing block; Unexpected urgent request from a sponsor/collaborator.
-   Contingency plans: If script writing stalls, switch to processing older data or work on short-form constellation TikTok video ideas. If too tired for a walk, do some indoor stretching. If urgent request comes in, assess priority and adjust tasks.
-   Desired emotional state: Focused, productive, managing anxiety, ending the workday with a sense of accomplishment despite the camera setback.

#### Tomorrow
-   Date: Approximately Day 15 of "This Month".
-   Key agenda items: Write full first draft of JWST YouTube script; Film any necessary talking head segments if script progresses well; Check cooler part shipping status; Plan content for the next week across platforms.
-   Personal goals: Stick to a slightly earlier bedtime tonight (~midnight); Take a proper lunch break away from the desk; Drink more water.
-   Work / study tasks: YouTube scripting/filming; Patreon community management; Respond to non-urgent emails/DMs; Review recent analytics.
-   Social or family commitments: None planned.
-   Health & self-care plans: Attempt the 20-minute walk again; Ensure proper meals are eaten (no skipping); Monitor allergy symptoms.
-   Logistics / travel needs: None, work from home. Need to be available if the cooler part delivery requires a signature (unlikely but possible).
-   Anticipated challenges: Maintaining focus on scripting without the immediate prospect of imaging; Potential delivery delays for the camera part; Feeling the pressure of the upcoming Carina imaging window closing.
-   Backup plans: If scripting is slow, pivot to editing backlog photos/videos for Instagram/Patreon. If weather is unexpectedly clear and a temporary cooler fix works, might attempt backyard imaging (less critical targets).
-   Motivational mantra for the day: "Control the controllables. Focus on creation, adapt to complications."
