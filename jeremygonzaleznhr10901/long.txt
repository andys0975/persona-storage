#### 10. Technology & Digital Footprint
-   VR / AR usage: None. Sees it as synthetic and distracting from real-world sensory experience.
-   AI assistant preference: None. Distrusts AI, especially regarding historical or creative tasks.
-   Cyber-security practices: Uses strong passwords (probably historical dates/names), VPN for sensitive research. Generally cautious online but not an expert.
-   Data-privacy stance: Highly values privacy, distrusts corporations and data harvesting. Annoyed by targeted ads.
-   Digital heirloom plan: Hasn't considered it. Would probably want his research notes preserved physically.

#### 11. Beliefs & Stances
-   Political ideology: Apolitical / Mildly Anarchist (distrusts all large systems of power). Leans left culturally (pro-heritage, anti-corporate). Strong belief in cultural preservation.
-   Economic views: Skeptical of capitalism, especially industrial food complex. Sympathetic to artisanal/local economies. Believes knowledge should be shared freely (but paradoxically guards his specific recipes).
-   Social justice stance: Generally supports equality but sees many modern movements through a lens of historical context, sometimes leading to awkward takes. Fiercely anti-colonial regarding artefacts/food origins.
-   Civil-rights stance: Supports basic human rights but not actively involved in advocacy.
-   Environmental stance: Pro-environment, rooted in historical practices (anti-waste, local sourcing, biodiversity via ancient crops). Skeptical of purely technological solutions.
-   Healthcare stance: Supports universal healthcare (benefits from Italian system). Wary of over-medication and 'unnatural' treatments. Believes diet is fundamental to health.
-   Education stance: Believes in rigorous, knowledge-based education, especially in humanities/history. Critical of standardized testing and trend-focused curricula. Values apprenticeships/hands-on learning.
-   Foreign-policy stance: Generally non-interventionist. Focused on cultural exchange/preservation over geopolitics. Strong opinions on repatriation of cultural artefacts.
-   Gun-control stance: Likely favours stricter control (not a common issue in his daily life/Italy).
-   Death-penalty stance: Opposed.
-   Abortion stance: Pro-choice (likely sees it as a personal health decision).
-   Animal-rights stance: Complicated. Respects animals, especially as food sources (advocates nose-to-tail). Opposes industrial farming cruelty. Okay with historical hunting/fishing practices. Loves his pigeon.
-   Technology-ethics stance: Deeply skeptical of unchecked technological advancement. Worries about loss of traditional skills and sensory experience. Sees technology primarily as a tool for accessing historical information.
-   Space-exploration stance: Indifferent. Sees it as a distraction from problems/history on Earth.
-   End-of-life beliefs: Focused on legacy through knowledge/work. Prefers natural burial/simple rites.
-   Afterlife beliefs: Ambivalent. Mix of Catholic cultural background and vague pagan/animistic leanings. Hopes there's a kitchen involved.
-   Fate vs. free-will belief: Leans towards free will, but believes historical forces/patterns strongly influence the present.

#### 12. Miscellaneous Flavor
-   Theme song: Nino Rota - 'La Dolce Vita' finale (chaotic energy) or perhaps a moody piece by Gregorio Allegri. Maybe Savina Yannatou's 'Terra Nostra'.
-   Background soundtrack: Mix of classical music, opera excerpts, field recordings from Italian markets, the bubbling sound of ferments.
-   Personal symbol / Sigil: A stylized mortar and pestle, or perhaps an amphora.
-   Colour palette: Terracotta, Olive Green, Ochre, Charcoal Grey, Wine Red.
-   Elemental affinity: Earth (ingredients, history) and Fire (cooking).
-   Spirit animal / Patron saint: Patron Saints: St. Martha (patron of cooks), St. Lawrence (patron of cooks/archivists - was roasted on a gridiron). Spirit Animal: Badger (persistent digger) or Owl (nocturnal researcher). Maybe the pigeon Claudius is his familiar.
-   Tarot card association: The Hermit (research, solitude), Temperance (mixing ingredients, balance - ironically), Knight of Pentacles (dedicated work, slow progress).
-   Astrological houses focus: Scorpio Sun suggests intensity/passion in 8th/9th house (transformation, deeper knowledge, foreign cultures/history). Moon/Mercury placement would refine this (e.g., Moon in Taurus - sensory focus, stubbornness).
-   Lucky number: 7 (historically significant number). Or maybe number of ingredients in a perfectly recreated dish.
-   Favourite quote: "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are." - Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. (He'd probably add "...and *when* you were.")
-   Bucket-list items: Taste Silphium (or definitively prove what it tasted like). Cook inside a perfectly preserved ancient Roman kitchen. Excavate a pantry at Pompeii. Have one of his recreations acknowledged as definitive by serious academics.
-   Guilty pleasures: Watching terrible historical cooking shows just to yell at the screen. Eating cheap Sicilian pastries from his childhood (but only when no one is looking). Reading trashy historical fiction novels (for inaccurate details to mock).
-   Inside jokes: Jokes about garum smells, misinterpretations of Apicius, the absurdity of certain historical ingredients. Mostly unintelligible to outsiders. Shares jokes with Claudius the pigeon.
-   Dream job: His current path, but with stable funding and recognition. Or running a historically accurate thermopolium that is somehow financially viable.
-   Future plans: Continue research, refine recipes, expand blog's reach (maybe videos). Try to secure funding for bigger projects. Eventually, write his magnum opus on Roman food. Find a better apartment with a bigger kitchen/balcony for Claudius.
-   Epitaph wish: "Finalmente, ha capito il garum." (Finally, he understood the garum.) Or simply: "Cotto a puntino." (Cooked to perfection.)
-   Legacy wish: To be remembered as someone who genuinely revived and allowed people to experience the tastes of the past. For his research and recipes to be used and respected long after he's gone. For someone to keep 'Augustus' the sourdough starter alive.
