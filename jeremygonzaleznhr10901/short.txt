#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
- Top milestones / turning points: Successfully recreated a passable version of *Oxygala* (Roman fermented milk dish) after several failed attempts. Completed a short consultancy gig identifying ancient cooking residues on pottery shards for a small regional museum (payment received, mostly spent).
- Key projects or tasks completed: Published a detailed blog post series on the history and variations of Roman *puls* (porridge). Finished translating a difficult section of Palladius related to olive preservation.
- Major challenges faced: A batch of experimental garum fermented incorrectly, creating an exceptionally foul odour (even for garum) and wasting expensive fish. Ran into issues sourcing authentic *laserpicium* substitute (Asafoetida of specific quality). Frustration with museum bureaucracy during consultancy.
- New relationships or contacts: Brief, formal email exchange with the museum curator (Dr. Rossi) – mostly transactional. Engaged in a lengthy, argumentative thread on a history forum about the true ingredients of Carthaginian *Punic*) stew.
- Health / fitness changes: Period of increased acid reflux due to stress and tasting failed experiments. Continued below-average fitness; slight back pain from hunching over texts.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Received payment from museum consultancy (~€400). Spent most of it on rare ingredients (imported fish for garum attempt, specific herbs), overdue rent, and replacement replica terracotta pot (cracked the old one). Income low, expenses high (research materials).
- Skills practiced or learned: Refined techniques for identifying food residues based on archaeological reports. Practiced translating late Latin agricultural texts. Honed skills in hearth cooking using replica brazier.
- Travel or relocations: None. Confined to Rome apartment/local markets/libraries.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Re-read sections of Apicius and Cato the Elder. Critiqued a popular TV documentary about Pompeii for its culinary inaccuracies (loudly, to Claudius the pigeon). Read several academic papers on Roman trade routes.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Mix of intense focus (research/cooking), frustration (failed experiments, finances), fleeting satisfaction (consultancy completion, *Oxygala* success), and general grumpiness.
- Lessons learned: Reaffirmed belief that museum work pays poorly but provides access. Learned (again) the precise conditions needed for *this specific* garum recipe are elusive. Importance of triple-checking translation nuances.
- Unresolved issues carried forward: Need for stable income. Sourcing reliable *laserpicium* substitute. The lingering smell of bad garum. Desire to start Moretum research.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
- Key projects or tasks is working on: Deep dive into *Moretum* (Roman cheese/herb spread) recipes – comparing textual sources, experimenting with herb combinations. Drafting blog post about the *Oxygala* experiments. Attempting to make historically plausible sourdough starter food for 'Augustus' using only spelt flour. Planning a small batch of *posca* (vinegar-water drink).
- Major challenges faced: Sourcing fresh, appropriate herbs for *Moretum* out of main season. Laptop fan started making ominous noises during a research binge. Blog ad revenue lower than expected. Avoiding arguments with sister over upcoming holiday obligations.
- New relationships or contacts: Tentative email exchange with a potential supplier of ancient grains found via an online forum – verifying authenticity. Brief interaction with a fellow enthusiast at the Testaccio market over the quality of pecorino.
- Health / fitness changes: Trying (sporadically) to walk more to manage stress and back pain. Increased coffee consumption due to research intensity. Making an effort to eat slightly more regularly. Still experiencing occasional reflux.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Low income (blog revenue only). Expenses: market ingredients for experiments, paid for access to a digital archive of rare manuscripts, bought more coffee. Considering buying a new (secondhand) mortar. Financial situation precarious.
- Skills practiced or learned: Fine-tuning cheese-making adjustments for *Moretum*. Practicing identification of wild herbs (some relevant to *Moretum*). Improving photo documentation of cooking processes for the blog.
- Travel or relocations: None. Potential short trip to Ostia Antica for market/food stall inspiration if bus fare can be spared.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Reading Pliny the Elder on herbs, Columella on cheese. Skimming online forums for discussions on Roman food. Listening to classical music while cooking. Avoided most modern media.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Obsessive focus on *Moretum*, anxiety about finances and technology failure, irritation at external demands (family), bursts of passion when discussing research online. Underlying determination.
- Lessons learned: Digital archives are useful but expensive. Fresh herbs are always superior, even if less "authentic" than dried depending on context. Need a better system for backing up research notes.
- People invited / accompanying: None. Prefers solitary work. Claudius the pigeon is constant company.
- Personal boundaries / taboos to respect: Do not suggest modernizing recipes. Do not question his interpretation of historical texts without strong evidence. Do not touch his research notes or 'Augustus'. Avoid discussing pineapple on pizza. Do not waste ingredients.
- Flexible time blocks: Late nights are usually dedicated research/writing time. Early mornings often involve market trips or baking. Afternoons flexible depending on cooking experiment timings.
- Weekend plans: More research and *Moretum* experimentation. Possibly a longer walk through Roman ruins if weather permits. Write blog post draft. Complain about weekend crowds at historical sites.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
- Long-range goal(s): Submit a small grant proposal to a cultural heritage foundation for funding research into Sicilian medieval food links to North Africa. Finalize and publish definitive *Moretum* recipe/article. Start planning a project on Roman breads using different yeasts/starters.
- Major events / travel booked: None booked. Hopes to visit a specific archaeological library archive in Naples if grant allows or funds miraculously appear. Possible family obligation visit to Sicily (viewed with trepidation).
- Expected milestones: Grant proposal submitted. *Moretum* article published on blog. Successful cultivation of a specific historical yeast strain (maybe).
- Skill-building targets: Improve proficiency in reading medieval Latin culinary manuscripts. Learn basic video editing to potentially add short clips to blog. Practice baking with different wood types for flavour infusion.
- Savings / investment goals: Goal: Accumulate enough funds for the Naples research trip (€200-300). Ideal: Establish a tiny emergency fund (€100). Realistically: End the month not deeper in debt. No investments.
- Equipment or resources to acquire: Need a more reliable laptop (aspirational). A specific type of replica Roman baking cloche (saving up). Bulk purchase of high-quality spelt and emmer flour. Access to that Naples library archive.
- Relationship intentions: Maintain minimal necessary contact with family. Continue engaging with relevant online communities. Avoid any situation requiring significant emotional vulnerability or social effort. Hope the ancient grains supplier proves reliable.
- Health benchmarks: Aim to reduce reliance on antacids through dietary adjustments (fewer failed experiments?). Attempt one long walk per week. Try to regulate sleep schedule slightly (unlikely).
- Seasonal or cultural celebrations: Acknowledges All Saints'/All Souls' Day (Nov 1/2) with perhaps a traditional Sicilian bake or leaving an offering for hearth spirits. Otherwise ignores modern holidays unless they provide research context.
- Contingency items: Plan B if grant fails (focus on smaller, blog-based projects, seek more consultancy work). Alternative ingredient sources if current ones fail. Have sister on standby for emergency loan (hates asking). Backup research notes onto external drive.
- End-of-month review date: Reviews progress erratically, usually when a project phase ends or panic sets in. Will likely assess grant situation and financial state around the 30th.
