#### Yesterday
- Primary location: Rome apartment (kitchen, study area). Briefly at a local outdoor market.
- Interactions & conversations: Short, transactional conversation with a market vendor about herb availability. Muttered complaints directed at Claudius the pigeon regarding laptop fan noise. Ignored one phone call from sister.
- Emotional high point: A brief moment of satisfaction when a particular combination of herbs for *Moretum* seemed promising in aroma.
- Emotional low point: Intense frustration when the laptop fan started making a loud grinding noise during a critical database search.
- Notable decisions made: Decided to postpone buying a new mortar and pestle due to budget constraints. Opted to try cleaning the laptop fan himself before seeking repairs.
- Problems encountered: Sourcing specific fresh herbs proving difficult. Laptop fan noise becoming unbearable. Realization that blog ad revenue was particularly low this cycle.
- Solutions attempted: Visited a different market stall for herbs (limited success). Attempted to ignore the laptop fan noise, then tried blowing compressed air into the vents (ineffective). Checked ad revenue dashboard repeatedly.
- Expenses incurred: €8 on various herbs (some not ideal) and a small piece of pecorino for *Moretum* experiments. €3 on compressed air can.
- Physical condition: Tired from late-night research. Slight backache from hunching. Mild acid reflux after tasting an overly acidic cheese/herb mixture.
- Media / entertainment: Read passages from Columella on cheese-making. Skimmed an online forum discussion on Roman agricultural practices.
- Bedtime & sleep quality: Around 2:30 AM. Sleep was fitful, disturbed by anxiety about the laptop and finances.

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
- Current location: Rome apartment (study area).
- Activities engaged in: Woke late (around 9:00 AM). Made coffee and ate leftover spelt bread. Spent an hour trying to carefully clean the laptop fan intake/exhaust ports with limited success (noise persists intermittently). Resumed *Moretum* research, comparing textual variations in Pliny the Elder. Ground some herbs acquired yesterday. Photographed the herb preparation process for the blog. Poured Claudius some water.
- People spoken to: None (apart from grumbling at Claudius).
- Food & drink consumed: Black coffee (two cups). Spelt bread. Water.
- Energy level: Moderate, boosted by coffee but undercut by poor sleep and frustration.
- Mood snapshot: Focused but irritable and anxious (laptop, finances). Determined to progress on *Moretum*.
- Unexpected events: The ancient grains supplier finally replied via email, confirming stock of emmer but asking for prepayment, raising authenticity verification questions.
- Items gained / lost: Gained email confirmation from potential supplier. Lost some patience with the laptop.

#### Later Today (upcoming)
- Planned activities / appointments: Attempt another *Moretum* test batch using yesterday's herbs. Draft sections of the *Oxygala* blog post. Make a small batch of *posca*. Research potential secondhand laptop prices online (depressing). Attempt to contact sister via text to preemptively manage holiday expectations briefly.
- Objectives / priorities: Achieve a tolerable *Moretum* consistency/flavour balance. Get >500 words drafted for the blog post. Avoid a lengthy phone call with sister. Assess the laptop situation realistically.
- People to meet / contact: Sister (via text, minimally). Potentially reply to the grain supplier email (cautiously).
- Required resources / preparations: Cheese, herbs, spelt flour, vinegar, water, mortar & pestle, replica pottery, camera, (temperamental) laptop, access to digital texts/notes. Coffee.
- Potential obstacles: Laptop failing completely. *Moretum* experiment failing. Running out of a key ingredient. Sister insisting on a phone call. Grain supplier seeming unreliable.
- Contingency plans: If laptop dies, resort to pen and paper notes/library computer for essential online tasks. If *Moretum* fails, document the failure meticulously for the blog. If sister calls, keep it short and deflect. Delay replying to supplier if unsure.
- Desired emotional state: Calm focus, perhaps a small sense of accomplishment if an experiment goes well or writing flows.

#### Tomorrow
- Date: (Assuming Today is approx. Day 18 of "This Month") Approx. Day 19.
- Key agenda items: Refine *Moretum* based on today's results. Continue drafting *Oxygala* blog post. Begin outlining the grant proposal structure and required components. Make spelt sourdough starter food for 'Augustus'.
- Personal goals: Stick to a slightly earlier bedtime tonight. Take a 30-minute walk, maybe near Circus Maximus, to clear head.
- Work / study tasks: Research grant guidelines from the cultural heritage foundation website. Translate another short passage related to cheese preservation. Organize digital research notes and back them up onto external drive.
- Social or family commitments: Avoid any if possible. Monitor email for grain supplier response or museum contact follow-up (unlikely).
- Health & self-care plans: Attempt a proper lunch (not just bread/cheese). Drink *posca* instead of third coffee. Try the walk. Ensure Claudius has fresh food/water.
- Logistics / travel needs: Check bus fares and opening times for Ostia Antica online (if laptop cooperates). Ensure enough spelt flour is on hand.
- Anticipated challenges: Laptop performance hindering research/writing. Difficulty sourcing specific information for the grant proposal outline. Distractions (internal anxiety or external demands). Maintaining motivation if *Moretum* progress stalls.
- Backup plans: If laptop is unusable for grant research, plan a library visit for the day after. If *Moretum* stalls, switch focus entirely to the *Oxygala* blog post or grant outline. If feeling overwhelmed, focus solely on routine tasks like feeding 'Augustus' and tidying research space.
- Motivational mantra for the day: "Persistence, not perfection. Document everything."
