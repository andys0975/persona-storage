#### Yesterday
- Primary location: Workshop venue (likely a rented space or community hall in Selangor), then back home in Cyberjaya.
- Interactions & conversations: Extensive interactions with workshop participants (teaching, answering questions, guiding hands-on activities). Brief coordination with friend who helped setup/takedown. Polite farewells. Responded briefly to a few urgent DMs later in the evening.
- Emotional high point: Witnessing participants' enthusiasm and "aha!" moments during the hands-on terrarium building segment. Receiving specific positive feedback on the clarity of explanations.
- Emotional low point: Feeling completely drained and socially overloaded by the end of the workshop. Momentary panic when the projector flickered mid-presentation. Mild anxiety managing diverse skill levels.
- Notable decisions made: Decided on the spot to provide an extra type of moss for the terrariums based on participant interest. Determined how to gently manage a participant who was over-handling sensitive plants.
- Problems encountered: Projector flickering (resolved by checking cable). Running slightly behind schedule during the Q&A. One participant accidentally spilled some substrate mix.
- Solutions attempted: Reseated projector cable. Gently steered Q&A back on track to manage time. Quickly cleaned up the spill with minimal fuss. Provided extra guidance to the participant who spilled.
- Expenses incurred: Possible final payment for venue rental, lunch/snacks for helper, maybe reimbursed helper for travel. Replenishing specific workshop supplies used up.
- Physical condition: Exhausted, slightly sore feet/back from standing and demonstrating, mild headache from concentration and social interaction. Voice slightly hoarse.
- Media / entertainment: None - too tired. Maybe scrolled social media briefly before sleep.
- Bedtime & sleep quality: Very late (around 1:30 AM after unpacking essentials and a final greenhouse check). Sleep was deep initially but short (~5.5 hours), likely interrupted by lingering thoughts about the workshop or plant checks.

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
- Current location: Home base in Cyberjaya (rotating between living area, home office, and greenhouse).
- Activities engaged in: Woke up late. Essential greenhouse check (priority due to heat spell and recent neglect during workshop focus), watering sensitive species, adjusting ventilation/shading. Unpacking remaining workshop materials/gear. Making strong coffee. Answering most urgent emails/messages (e.g., workshop follow-up questions). Sorting through photos/videos taken at the workshop.
- People spoken to: Text message exchange with friend who helped yesterday (thanking them). Replied to a few Instagram comments.
- Food & drink consumed: Large mug of strong coffee, water, simple breakfast (toast with kaya). Planning a proper lunch soon.
- Energy level: Low to moderate. Still recovering from yesterday's exertion. Coffee helping.
- Mood snapshot: Relieved the workshop is over and went well. Tired but feeling a sense of accomplishment mixed with the pressure of catching up on plant care and content creation. Slightly scattered.
- Unexpected events: Received a very positive and detailed thank-you email from a workshop participant, which was a nice boost. Noticed one *Nepenthes* pitcher looking slightly stressed from the heat.
- Items gained / lost: Gained: Positive feedback email, slightly more organized workshop gear. Lost: None.

#### Later Today (upcoming)
- Planned activities / appointments: Thorough plant health inspection and preventative spraying (IPM). Start editing workshop photos/videos for social media recap. Respond to non-urgent workshop follow-up emails. Pack any outstanding online orders for shipping tomorrow. Plan the terrarium video filming schedule for the coming days. Maybe a short, quiet walk if energy permits.
- Objectives / priorities: Ensure plant health is stable post-workshop neglect & heat. Clear communication backlog from workshop. Get online orders ready. Create a clear plan for the terrarium video project.
- People to meet / contact: Send out a general thank-you message/email to all workshop attendees (possibly with links to resources). Reply to DMs/comments accumulated over the weekend.
- Required resources / preparations: Computer with editing software, camera memory cards, plant care supplies (mister, IPM solutions, water), packing materials. List of attendees' emails.
- Potential obstacles: Overwhelming fatigue setting in. Discovering a significant plant health issue requiring immediate, time-consuming action. Feeling unmotivated to start editing.
- Contingency plans: Prioritize plant health above all else. If too tired for editing, focus on organizing files or simpler tasks like cleaning propagation trays. Postpone order packing if absolutely necessary (unlikely preference). Allow for rest breaks.
- Desired emotional state: Calm, organized, feeling back in control of routine, satisfied with catching up.

#### Tomorrow
- Date: June 20th (Assuming today is June 19th)
- Key agenda items: Ship online orders packed today. Begin filming terrarium video (setup shots, substrate layers). Detailed check on newly acquired *Utricularia* acclimatization progress. Follow up with botanical garden contact regarding potential collaboration.
- Personal goals: Aim for 6.5 hours of sleep tonight. Take a proper lunch break away from work area. Spend 15 minutes stretching or doing light mobility exercises.
- Work / study tasks: Edit and post workshop recap on social media (Instagram story/post). Review terrarium video script against filmed footage. Research specific lighting requirements for epiphytic *Utricularia*.
- Social or family commitments: None planned. Focus on work and recovery.
- Health & self-care plans: Continue diligent hydration. Monitor allergy symptoms. Prepare a healthy meal instead of relying on quick snacks. Take short screen breaks every hour.
- Logistics / travel needs: Trip to the post office/courier drop-off point. May need to purchase distilled water or specific fertilizer if supplies are low.
- Anticipated challenges: Managing time effectively between filming, plant care, and admin tasks. Maintaining focus while editing. Potential for continued high temperatures impacting greenhouse.
- Backup plans: If weather is unsuitable for filming specific shots, switch to editing or voiceover recording. If botanical garden contact doesn't reply, draft a follow-up reminder for later in the week. If feeling overwhelmed, focus only on critical plant care and shipping orders.
- Motivational mantra for the day: "Restore balance. Nurture the plants, nurture the projects, nurture yourself."
