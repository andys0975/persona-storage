#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
- Top milestones / turning points: Successfully propagated a particularly finicky *Nepenthes* species after several failed attempts. Received positive feedback on a detailed YouTube video about pitcher peristome function.
- Key projects or tasks completed: Finished editing and uploaded Part 3 of YouTube series on Malaysian *Drosera*. Fulfilled all outstanding online plant orders. Completed major greenhouse clean-out and pest check. Prepared materials for upcoming workshop.
- Major challenges faced: Minor fungus gnat outbreak in the *Drosera* section (controlled with IPM). A crucial environmental sensor temporarily malfunctioned, causing anxiety. Slight delay processing a CITES permit application for a potential plant exchange.
- New relationships or contacts: Connected with a promising young CP enthusiast via Instagram DMs, offering advice. Corresponded via email with a university researcher about *Nepenthes* pollinators.
- Health / fitness changes: Experienced mild pollen allergy symptoms due to neighbour's landscaping. Sleep schedule remained irregular due to late-night research and plant checks. Maintained moderate fitness from physical work.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Received income from YouTube ads and online plant sales (average month). Incurred expenses for new potting media, beneficial insects (IPM), and shipping supplies. Purchased a replacement pH meter.
- Skills practiced or learned: Refined macro photography lighting techniques for capturing dew on *Drosera*. Practiced specific tissue culture media preparation. Improved speed of responding to social media comments/questions.
- Travel or relocations: None. Focused work at home base in Cyberjaya.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Read several research papers on *Nepenthes* hybridization. Watched David Attenborough's "The Green Planet" again. Listened to Ologies podcast (specifically Mycology episode). Read a cozy mystery novel before bed.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Focused determination, quiet satisfaction (propagation success), underlying anxiety (plant health, finances), mild frustration (pests, bureaucracy).
- Lessons learned: Reinforced the necessity of daily pest monitoring. Learned a more efficient way to organize digital plant records. Realized the importance of having backup sensors.
- Unresolved issues carried forward: Pending CITES permit application. Planning for the next major content project after the *Drosera* series. Ongoing worry about funding stability.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
- Key projects or tasks is working on: Currently running (or just finished/about to start) a sold-out "Introduction to Carnivorous Plant Care" workshop. Filming and editing footage for a video on terrarium building for CPs. Acclimatizing newly acquired (legally sourced) *Utricularia* species. Monitoring recent propagations.
- Major challenges faced: Managing workshop logistics and participant questions (mild social anxiety). Juggling intensive plant care needs with content creation deadlines. Dealing with a sudden heat spell requiring adjustments to greenhouse cooling/humidity. Responding to a small wave of repetitive beginner questions online.
- New relationships or contacts: Interacting directly with workshop attendees. Follow-up communication with a contact at a local botanical garden regarding potential future collaboration on an educational display.
- Health / fitness changes: Increased stress/anxiety levels due to workshop and heat spell. Making a conscious effort to drink more water and take short breaks. Sleep remains around 6 hours, often interrupted. Experienced mild headache from screen time.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Income boost from workshop fees. Ongoing expenses for utilities (higher due to cooling). Purchased specific fertilizers and distilled water in bulk. Considering upgrading a grow light bulb.
- Skills practiced or learned: Public speaking and teaching skills during the workshop. Troubleshooting greenhouse climate control systems in response to weather. Experimenting with different substrate mixes for epiphytic *Utricularia*.
- Travel or relocations: Local travel within Selangor for workshop venue (if not at home) and purchasing supplies.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Re-reading chapters on terrarium science. Watching YouTube tutorials on video transitions. Listening to ambient nature soundscapes while working. Started reading "The Hidden Life of Trees" by Peter Wohlleben.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Mix of performance anxiety and enthusiasm for teaching. Heightened alertness regarding plant/greenhouse conditions. Satisfaction from sharing knowledge. Underlying fatigue.
- Lessons learned: Need to streamline workshop setup process. Importance of anticipating common questions. Realizing the value of delegating simple tasks if possible in future.
- People invited / accompanying: Workshop participants. Possibly asked a friend for minor help with workshop setup/takedown.
- Personal boundaries / taboos to respect: Explicitly stating "please do not touch the plants without permission" during workshop tours. Needing significant quiet/solitary time after the social demands of the workshop. Avoiding discussion of personal finances or relationship status.
- Flexible time blocks: Late evenings (often dedicated to research/plant checks). Parts of weekends not dedicated to the workshop are reserved for intensive plant care, photography, or quiet time.
- Weekend plans: If workshop is on weekend, fully dedicated to that. Otherwise, planning deep cleaning of propagation trays, repotting several larger *Nepenthes*, macro photography session with *Drosera*, planning next video script, maybe a short walk in a nearby park reserve if energy allows.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
- Long-range goal(s): Begin outlining content for a new YouTube series focusing on *Nepenthes* of Borneo. Start preliminary research for a potential field guide project. Allocate a specific percentage of income to the 'Conservation Center Fund'.
- Major events / travel booked: Planning to attend a meeting of the Malaysian Carnivorous Plant Society (local chapter). Considering a weekend trip to Cameron Highlands for botanizing (weather dependent).
- Expected milestones: Aiming for successful rooting of cuttings from a rare *Drosera regia*. Hoping to reach a specific subscriber count milestone on YouTube. Finalize decision on the topic for the next online workshop.
- Skill-building targets: Focus on improving video editing workflow speed using keyboard shortcuts. Dedicate time to study recent taxonomic updates in the *Nepenthes* genus. Practice creating more engaging Instagram Reels.
- Savings / investment goals: Deposit a set amount (e.g., RM 300-500) into the Conservation Center savings account. Add a small contribution to personal EPF (retirement fund).
- Equipment or resources to acquire: Researching and saving towards a more reliable automated misting system component for the greenhouse. Need to order more sphagnum moss and perlite.
- Relationship intentions: Schedule a video call with her botanist best friend. Plan to email her former university professor for a brief catch-up and potentially ask for advice on the field guide idea.
- Health benchmarks: Aim to achieve a more consistent sleep schedule (target 6.5-7 hours nightly). Plan at least one dedicated longer hike/nature immersion day for stress relief. Monitor pollen levels and manage allergies proactively.
- Seasonal or cultural celebrations: Prepare greenhouse for potentially increased rainfall. Observe Hari Raya Haji privately/culturally (simple meal, reflection).
- Contingency items: Have backup pest control measures (biological agents, insecticidal soap) readily available. Outline a simpler 'evergreen' video topic in case the Borneo series research takes longer than expected. Maintain emergency fund level.
- End-of-month review date: Schedule for the last Sunday of the month to review finances, plant health records, project progress, and goal achievement.
