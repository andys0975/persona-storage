#### Yesterday (Saturday)
- **Primary location:** Home/Workshop (Accra), Makola Market, Local bar/restaurant (e.g., Osu).
- **Interactions & conversations:** Haggled with fabric vendors at Makola. Met Adwoa, Kofi, and Esi for drinks; discussed work (Ben's flakiness, grant stress), creative ideas, the gallery prospect, and general life updates. Brief, inconclusive WhatsApp exchange with Ben about denim.
- **Emotional high point:** Finding a small batch of unique vintage wax print scraps at Makola for a good price. Laughing with friends in the evening, feeling supported.
- **Emotional low point:** Frustration at Makola finding less usable material than hoped within budget. A wave of anxiety discussing the looming rent payment with friends.
- **Notable decisions made:** Decided against buying a large piece of expensive Kente cloth she saw at Makola. Agreed to try photographing stock today (Sunday). Tentatively agreed to brainstorm stage outfit ideas with Kofi next week.
- **Problems encountered:** Couldn't find the specific weight of denim needed (the one Ben was supposed to source). Traffic was heavy returning from Makola. Overlocker ('Serge Gainsbourg') made a suspicious clunking sound during a quick test.
- **Solutions attempted:** Took photos of alternative denim options to potentially show the client. Listened to Pat Thomas vinyl loudly to de-stress from traffic. Made a note to add 'Overlocker Service' to the budget *if* the grant comes through.
- **Expenses incurred:** Tro-tro fares (~15 GHS), Makola purchases (scraps, thread, maybe street food ~ 80 GHS), Shared food/drinks with friends (~70 GHS).
- **Physical condition:** Tired feet and slight backache after Makola. Felt relaxed and energized after meeting friends.
- **Media / entertainment:** Radio/playlist during transport, Pat Thomas vinyl at home, Afrobeat music at the bar, lively conversation with friends.
- **Bedtime & sleep quality:** Around 1:00 AM. Sleep was okay, maybe 6.5 hours, slightly interrupted by traffic noise.

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (Sunday - already happened)
- **Current location:** Home/Workshop in Accra.
- **Activities engaged in:** Woke up around 8:30 AM. Made coffee & moringa smoothie. Tidied sewing space. Reviewed the patchwork dress sketches, still feeling blocked. Switched to working on the Kente skirt alteration (seam adjustments). Listened to a 'Business of Fashion' podcast episode. Responded to two Instagram DMs about skirt availability.
- **People spoken to:** Brief greeting with landlord passing outside. Text exchange with cousin confirming family call later. Instagram DM replies (text).
- **Food & drink consumed:** Coffee, Mango-Moringa smoothie, Water. Ate leftover Waakye for a late breakfast/early lunch (~11:00 AM).
- **Energy level:** Started slow (6/10), increased to a steady (7/10) while working on the Kente skirt.
- **Mood snapshot:** Calm but slightly anxious baseline. Focused during sewing. Mildly frustrated about the patchwork dress block. Anticipating the family call positively.
- **Unexpected events:** Brief power outage (less than 5 mins). Found a spool of the 'preferred thread colour' she thought was finished, but only a small amount left.
- **Items gained / lost:** Gained progress on Kente skirt alteration. Found a small amount of needed thread. Lost about 30 mins scrolling Instagram looking for patchwork inspiration (procrastination).

#### Later Today (Sunday - upcoming)
- **Planned activities / appointments:** Finish Kente skirt alterations (needs pressing). Attempt to photograph 5-6 finished items (skirts, accessories) near the window during peak daylight (next 2 hours). Call family (~5 PM). Dedicate 1 hour to sketching new ideas for the patchwork dress. Attempt 30 mins of bookkeeping on the phone app. Cook dinner (Jollof rice planned).
- **Objectives / priorities:** Complete Kente alteration. Get usable photos for Instagram/shop update. Connect with family. Generate at least 3 new sketch variations for the patchwork dress. Log recent expenses in the app.
- **People to meet / contact:** Family (via phone/video call). Maybe text Adwoa later for accountability check ("Did you do your admin?").
- **Required resources / preparations:** Iron/ironing board, sewing machine, phone/camera, good natural light, charged phone, sketchbook, pencils, bookkeeping app, Jollof ingredients. Sobolo drink ready for the admin attempt.
- **Potential obstacles:** Light fading too quickly for photos. Persistent creative block. Family call runs long. Feeling too tired/unmotivated for admin. Forgetting a key Jollof ingredient.
- **Contingency plans:** If photos fail, focus entirely on the patchwork dress sketching. If blocked on dress, work on cutting out accessory pieces. If admin feels impossible, schedule it firmly for Monday morning. Order Indomie if Jollof fails.
- **Desired emotional state:** Accomplished, creatively stimulated (even if dress isn't solved), connected, and relatively calm before the start of the work week.

#### Tomorrow (Monday)
- **Date:** [Assuming Today is Sun, May 19th, 2024] Monday, May 20th, 2024
- **Key agenda items:** Contact gallery owner (follow-up email). Call Ben re: denim sourcing (be firm). Dedicate morning block (at least 2 hours) to patchwork dress construction/problem-solving. Work on grant application text (aim to finish first draft).
- **Personal goals:** Wake up by 7:00 AM. Do 15 mins of back/wrist stretches. Drink 2 litres of water. Take a proper lunch break away from the workspace.
- **Work / study tasks:** Patchwork dress (cutting/sewing). Grant application (writing/editing). Final press/pack Kente skirt. Plan 3 Instagram posts for the week. Respond to emails/DMs.
- **Social or family commitments:** Possible brief meeting with Kofi to discuss stage outfit concepts (if he confirms time). Quick check-in call/text with Adwoa.
- **Health & self-care plans:** Stretches, water intake, scheduled lunch break. Aim for lights out by 11:30 PM. Maybe a short evening walk.
- **Logistics / travel needs:** May need Tro-tro fare for meeting Kofi or an emergency supply run. Ensure phone has data/credit for calls/emails.
- **Anticipated challenges:** Ben being unavailable or non-committal. Hitting a technical wall with the patchwork dress. Feeling overwhelmed by grant application details. Financial anxiety might spike thinking about end-of-month bills.
- **Backup plans:** If Ben fails, spend 30 mins researching alternative denim suppliers online/via contacts. If dress is blocked, switch to grant writing or accessory production. Break grant writing into smaller chunks. Use mindfulness techniques if anxiety spikes.
- **Motivational mantra for the day:** "Forward is forward. Focus on the next seam, the next sentence, the next cedi."
