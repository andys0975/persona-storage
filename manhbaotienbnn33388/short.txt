#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
-   **Top milestones / turning points:** Successfully completed a challenging custom commission for a prominent blogger (paid late, but paid!). Had a small breakthrough with a tricky natural indigo dye batch after several failures.
-   **Key projects or tasks completed:** Finished the aforementioned blogger commission (upcycled denim and wax print fusion jacket). Created 3 new skirt designs for her Instagram shop update using rescued tablecloth linen. Mended a pile of clothes for Adwoa in exchange for proofreading grant application text.
-   **Major challenges faced:** Running dangerously low on funds before the blogger payment came through. 'Serge Gainsbourg' (the overlocker) started making a terrifying noise (temporarily fixed with percussive maintenance and oil). Nearly missed a deadline due to underestimating cutting time for a complex pattern. Fabric sourcing trip yielded less usable material than hoped.
-   **New relationships or contacts:** Met a potential supplier for ethically sourced zippers through Esi. Had a promising chat with a gallery owner about potentially stocking some accessory pieces. Reconnected briefly with an old university tutor.
-   **Health / fitness changes:** Suffered a stress migraine mid-month. Wrist RSI flared up after a marathon sewing session. Mostly walked everywhere as usual. Started adding moringa powder to morning smoothies (when she remembered).
-   **Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases):** Received payment for the blogger commission (covered rent + immediate debts). Sold two skirts online. Spent significantly on quality interfacing and replacement machine needles. Impulse buy of a small stack of vintage wax prints she couldn't resist at Makola. Still behind on 'Betsy's' payment plan.
-   **Skills practiced or learned:** Refined natural indigo dyeing technique (patience!). Practiced draping on the mannequin for a potential future design. Improved haggling skills slightly during the Makola trip.
-   **Travel or relocations:** Several trips across Accra for fabric sourcing (Makola, Kantamanto periphery), client meetings, and supply runs. No major relocations.
-   **Notable media consumed (books, shows, games):** Binged a season of a Nigerian reality show ('Real Housewives of Lagos'). Listened to a lot of Pat Thomas vinyl while working. Read articles about sustainable fashion trends in Africa. Started Yaa Gyasi's "Homegoing" but got distracted.
-   **Dominant emotions / mood trend:** Cycle of deadline-induced anxiety followed by relief/satisfaction, frustration with finances and machine issues, punctuated by creative excitement. Generally optimistic baseline but prone to stress spikes.
-   **Lessons learned:** Double-check *all* machine settings *before* starting on expensive fabric. Blogger exposure doesn't pay bills immediately. Must factor in "chaos time" when quoting deadlines.
-   **Unresolved issues carried forward:** The precarious financial situation. The need for a proper overlocker repair/service. The ongoing disorganization of the fabric stash. The ambiguous 'situationship' with Ben. The half-finished grant application.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
-   **Key projects or tasks is working on:** Two custom orders: an upcycled patchwork dress for a wedding guest, and altering a vintage Kente skirt for a client. Developing a small capsule collection of accessories (headwraps, tote bags) from the smallest scraps for the gallery owner. *Trying* to photograph existing stock professionally for online updates. Attempting to finally submit the grant application.
-   **Major challenges faced:** Creative block on the patchwork dress design. Ben (the textile importer) is being flaky about sourcing specific denim requested by a client. Running out of her preferred thread colour. Juggling custom work demands with trying to build stock. Avoiding admin tasks like bookkeeping.
-   **New relationships or contacts:** Following up with the gallery owner. Potential collaboration chat with Kofi (musician) about stage outfits (low budget, high creativity). Meeting a cousin's friend who works in film production (networking for the Afrofuturist dream!).
-   **Health / fitness changes:** Trying to incorporate more stretching to combat back pain. Making an effort to drink more water. Sleep schedule still chaotic due to work patterns. Attended an outdoor Afrobeat dance class with friends.
-   **Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases):** Received deposit for the wedding guest dress commission. Sold a few small items via Instagram DMs. Had to buy emergency thread at a higher price. Planning a significant fabric purchase if the grant comes through or if Ben pays for a previous informal sourcing favour. Rent is due soon.
-   **Skills practiced or learned:** Experimenting with zero-waste pattern cutting for the accessories. Practicing more complex alterations (the Kente skirt). Attempting basic bookkeeping using a phone app (with limited success). Learning lyrics to new Stonebwoy tracks.
-   **Travel or relocations:** Daily Accra travel for errands. Potential short trip to a bead market outside Accra if time/funds allow.
-   **Notable media consumed (books, shows, games):** Listening to sustainability podcasts during cutting/sewing. Watching documentaries about West African textile history on YouTube. Finally finished "Homegoing". Scrolling Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration (and procrastination).
-   **Dominant emotions / mood trend:** Mix of creative focus (when in the zone), anxiety (finances, deadlines, Ben), frustration (admin, disorganization), and sparks of excitement (new contacts, design ideas). Feeling the pressure mount for end-of-month bills.
-   **Lessons learned:** Saying 'yes' to too many small things dilutes focus from bigger projects. Need a better system for tracking threads/notions inventory. Ben's unreliability is a pattern.
-   **People invited / accompanying:** Met friends (Adwoa, Kofi, Esi) for drinks/food. Potential meeting with the cousin's film contact. Ongoing interactions with Ben. Regular calls with family.
-   **Personal boundaries / taboos to respect:** Avoid asking direct questions about the exact status of the 'situationship' with Ben unless she brings it up. Don't critique her workspace organization unless offering practical help she accepts. Respect her process, even if it looks chaotic. Do not imply Ghanaian Jollof isn't the best. Avoid bringing up the Pink Dye Incident unless she does (likely humorously).
-   **Flexible time blocks:** Late nights are common work times. Early mornings are usually slow/sleepy. Weekends often involve work but also market visits or socialising. Responds well to spontaneous (but respectful) invitations if not on a tight deadline.
-   **Weekend plans:** Likely working on commissions, possibly visiting Makola market for inspiration/supplies on Saturday morning, meeting friends Saturday evening, potential call with family Sunday. Might try to tackle photographing stock if the light is good.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
-   **Long-range goal(s):** Secure enough stable income to hire a part-time assistant (even just for admin/cutting). Finalize designs for a small, cohesive collection for Lagos Fashion Week application (deadline likely further out, but needs groundwork). Get 'Sankofa Stitches' formally registered as a business.
-   **Major events / travel booked:** Tentatively planning a trip to Kumasi to visit family for a weekend, coinciding with sourcing Adinkra stamps and potentially some rare Kente scraps. Hoping to attend an Accra Art Week opening event.
-   **Expected milestones:** Completing the current two custom orders. Delivering the first batch of accessories to the gallery. Hearing back about the grant application (fingers crossed!). Potentially getting the overlocker properly serviced.
-   **Skill-building targets:** Wants to properly learn digital pattern drafting basics via an online tutorial. Aims to perfect one new natural dye colour (e.g., a stable green or purple). Improve product photography skills.
-   **Savings / investment goals:** Ideal: Put aside 10% of any income into a separate 'Business Growth' pot (Realistic: Try to end the month with a small positive balance after paying debts). Start a dedicated savings envelope for the overlocker service.
-   **Equipment or resources to acquire:** A better lighting setup for photography. Bulk order of quality recycled packaging. A dress form that's closer to standard sizing. More storage containers (even if just repurposed boxes).
-   **Relationship intentions:** Have a clearer conversation with Ben about expectations (work and personal). Spend quality time with family during the Kumasi trip. Continue nurturing friendships and creative collaborations.
-   **Health benchmarks:** Aim for an average of 6.5 hours of sleep per night. Consistently do back/wrist stretches daily. Take a full day off work at least once a week. Schedule and attend the overlocker service appointment (reducing a source of stress!).
-   **Seasonal or cultural celebrations:** Depending on timing, might attend local community events or church services if invited by family/friends. Preparing for the Harmattan season - more dust, need to protect fabrics.
-   **Contingency items:** Backup plan if grant is rejected (focus on high-margin accessories, seek micro-loan?). Alternative supplier research if Ben remains unreliable. Keep basic first-aid supplies stocked for inevitable pinpricks/cuts. Have numbers for reliable Tro-tro alternatives if needed late at night.
-   **End-of-month review date:** Aim for the last Sunday of the month to review finances (however painful), project status, and set goals for the *following* month, likely over Sobolo and with Adwoa providing accountability.
