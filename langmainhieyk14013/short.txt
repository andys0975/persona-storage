#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
- Top milestones / turning points: Successfully explored and documented a derelict Soviet-era radar station complex near the Polish border. Reached 75% of his Patreon goal for a new low-light lens.
- Key projects or tasks completed: Edited and released a two-part video series on the radar station exploration. Completed a small freelance gig filming promotional material for a local underground artist.
- Major challenges faced: Dealing with unexpected security patrols near the radar site (required careful evasion). A primary hard drive started showing signs of failure, necessitating urgent data backup and replacement planning. Minor creative block during the initial editing phase of the radar footage.
- New relationships or contacts: Brief collaboration with the underground artist (professional contact only). Exchanged information with a fellow Berlin-based explorer ('Axel') regarding a potential future site lead.
- Health / fitness changes: Suffered a persistent cough for about a week after the radar station exploration due to heavy dust/mold exposure. Pulled a muscle in his shoulder during a tricky climb, requiring rest and limiting heavy lifting for a few days. Usual tinnitus flare-up.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Received Patreon payout (slightly lower than previous month). Income from freelance gig helped offset costs. Had to purchase a new external SSD for backup earlier than planned due to drive failure scare. Kept other expenses minimal (food, transport, cigarettes).
- Skills practiced or learned: Practiced advanced drone maneuvering within confined interior spaces at the radar station. Experimented with time-lapse techniques for capturing decay progression. Had to troubleshoot audio interference issues in the field recordings.
- Travel or relocations: 3-day trip to the German-Polish border region for the radar station exploration.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Watched Werner Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness". Read archival documents and online forums related to Soviet radar technology and Cold War infrastructure in Eastern Germany. Listened extensively to Biosphere's "Substrata" during editing.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Initial excitement and focus during exploration, followed by frustration (technical issues, physical discomfort), satisfaction upon video release, underlying financial anxiety.
- Lessons learned: Reinforced the need for redundant data backup solutions. Importance of having multiple access/egress routes planned for sensitive locations. Sometimes the best shots require patience and waiting for the right light/conditions, even when uncomfortable.
- Unresolved issues carried forward: The need for the new low-light lens remains. Financial stability is still precarious. The complex 'situationship' with Lena continues. The larger goal of finding the rumoured bunker complex. Lingering guilt/thoughts about Ukraine.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
- Key projects or tasks is working on: Deep into research and planning for the rumoured abandoned Cold War bunker complex (primary focus). Editing footage from a smaller, recently explored location (e.g., abandoned textile factory) for a single video release to keep content flowing. Ongoing Patreon engagement (updates, responding to comments).
- Major challenges faced: Difficulty confirming the exact location or access points for the bunker complex despite extensive map/archive research. Balancing time between research, editing, and potential need for another small freelance gig. Dealing with unreliable internet at the squat impacting uploads/research. Increasing spring foliage making reconnaissance harder.
- New relationships or contacts: Following up with 'Axel' on the potential site lead, possibly meeting for a cautious information exchange. Communicating more frequently with higher-tier Patrons via private Discord.
- Health / fitness changes: Trying to manage sleep schedule better but likely failing due to late-night research/editing sessions (averaging 5-6 hrs). Shoulder muscle feels mostly recovered. Increased caffeine intake. Consciously using a respirator more consistently during explorations.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Patreon income steady but still below lens goal. Actively looking for another quick freelance video job. Purchased some specific consumables (high-capacity batteries, memory cards) in anticipation of the bunker exploration. Expenses focused on transport for reconnaissance, food, basic supplies.
- Skills practiced or learned: Advanced satellite map analysis and cross-referencing with historical maps. Refining lockpicking skills on practice locks. Experimenting with SEO optimization for YouTube video titles/descriptions. Improving German skills negotiating access to archives or talking to potential local contacts (indirectly related to research).
- Travel or relocations: Several short day trips to the general area of the suspected bunker complex for ground reconnaissance (scouting potential access, observing patterns). Maybe one overnight trip if the area is further away.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Reading declassified Stasi archives (online), local history books about the Cold War period in the region. Watching analysis videos of Tarkovsky's "Stalker". Playing "Papers, Please" briefly as a distraction.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Intense focus and determination regarding the bunker search, punctuated by frustration at dead ends. Underlying stress about content pipeline and finances. Fleeting moments of excitement when finding promising clues. General guardedness.
- Lessons learned: The most promising leads often require patience and piecing together fragmented information from multiple sources. Ground reconnaissance is irreplaceable, even with good satellite imagery. Managing expectations during a difficult search is key to avoid burnout.
- People invited / accompanying: Primarily working solo on research and reconnaissance. Might coordinate with 'Axel' if the lead proves solid and requires a two-person team for safety/access, but trust is paramount and not yet fully established. 'Lena' is aware of his obsession but not directly involved.
- Personal boundaries / taboos to respect: Don't distract him during focused research/editing binges. Don't offer unsolicited advice about his methods unless asked. Respect his secrecy regarding potential locations. Avoid bringing up his departure from Ukraine unless he initiates. Don't expect emotional vulnerability.
- Flexible time blocks: Early afternoons might be slightly more flexible if not out on reconnaissance. Late nights are almost always occupied. Highly unpredictable schedule overall.
- Weekend plans: If not doing overnight reconnaissance, weekends will involve analyzing findings from the week, planning next steps for the bunker search, catching up on editing the factory footage, gear maintenance. Possibly a brief, low-key meeting with Lena or Axel at a familiar Neukölln bar.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
- Long-range goal(s): Successfully locate, access, explore, and document the Cold War bunker complex. Launch the resulting video series/documentary effort. Reach the Patreon goal for the new low-light lens.
- Major events / travel booked: Tentatively planning a multi-day (potentially 5-7 days) expedition for the bunker exploration if located. This is highly dependent on success in the current month's research. No other major travel booked yet.
- Expected milestones: Confirming bunker location and viable access point. Securing necessary supplies/resources for the extended exploration. Completing and releasing the textile factory video. Hopefully hitting the Patreon lens goal.
- Skill-building targets: If the bunker involves vertical access, practice specific ropework/knot techniques. Focus on advanced audio recording techniques for capturing subtle environmental sounds within the bunker. Learn more about Cold War era electronics/machinery identification.
- Savings / investment goals: Accumulate enough funds to cover travel, food, and potential contingencies for the bunker expedition. If Patreon goal is met, purchase the lens. Try to add slightly more to the emergency fund.
- Equipment or resources to acquire: The low-light lens (priority if funded). Possibly specific ropes or climbing aids depending on bunker access. Need to stock up on long-life food, water purification tablets, extensive first-aid supplies, backup lighting, and power banks for the multi-day trip. May need to rent a vehicle.
- Relationship intentions: Maintain the established level of contact with 'Lena'. If 'Axel' collaboration proceeds for the bunker, focus on clear communication and establishing trust during the operation. Minimal contact with family, maybe a short call to check in.
- Health benchmarks: Aim to get through the bunker exploration without significant injury or respiratory illness (ambitious). Try to catch up on sleep *after* the expedition/project launch. Schedule the tetanus booster.
- Seasonal or cultural celebrations: None. Will likely ignore any public holidays if they coincide with exploration or editing. Early summer weather might mean warmer conditions, potentially more insects/vegetation to deal with.
- Contingency items: Backup locations identified if the bunker proves inaccessible/non-existent. Plan B for funding if Patreon dips unexpectedly (e.g., taking on less desirable freelance work). Redundant gear (backup camera body, lights, etc.). Emergency communication plan (e.g., satellite messenger if area is remote).
- End-of-month review date: Approximately 30 days from now. Review success/failure of bunker mission, assess financial status post-expedition/lens purchase, analyze video performance, outline next project cycle.
