- Education stance: Believes in self-directed learning and practical skills over formal credentials. Critical of rigid education systems.
- Foreign-policy stance: Non-interventionist generally, except where authoritarianism/imperialism is blatant (e.g., Russia's invasion of Ukraine). Deeply distrusts geopolitical power plays.

#### 12. Miscellaneous Flavor
- Theme song: Godspeed You! Black Emperor - "Storm" or Biosphere - "Poa Alpina"
- Background soundtrack: Dark ambient, industrial soundscapes, post-rock crescendos during key moments.
- Personal symbol / Sigil: Stylized graphic of a crumbling building intertwined with a camera lens or aperture. Maybe incorporating subtle Ukrainian geometric folk patterns.
- Colour palette: Greys, dark blues, olive greens, rust orange, concrete textures, occasional flashes of bright hazard yellow/red.
- Elemental affinity: Earth (concrete, dust, rust) and Air (wind whistling through broken windows, atmosphere).
- Spirit animal / Patron saint: Crow (observant, intelligent, thrives in urban/marginal spaces) or maybe St. Jude (patron saint of lost causes).
- Tarot card association: The Hermit (introspection, guidance, solitude) or The Tower (sudden change, destruction, revelation).
- Astrological houses focus: Probably themes related to 4th House (home, roots, endings), 8th House (death, transformation, shared resources/debts), 12th House (secrets, subconscious, isolation, institutions).
- Lucky number: 13 (finds it fittingly ominous/contrarian).
- Favourite quote: "All that is solid melts into air." - Karl Marx (used ironically in context of literal decay) or a line from Tarkovsky's Stalker.
- Bucket-list items: Explore Pripyat/Chernobyl Exclusion Zone properly, explore Hashima Island (Japan), cross Siberia to find remote Soviet ghost towns, document the decaying infrastructure of Central Asia, find a truly undiscovered, significant location.
- Guilty pleasures: Watching cheesy disaster movies, eating instant noodles straight from the packet, spending hours scrolling through satellite maps looking for potential sites.
- Inside jokes: Mostly related to specific exploration mishaps or obscure historical facts with his few close friends. Uses specific code words for police/security.
- Dream job: What he's doing now, but with stable funding and complete creative freedom. Maybe directing a feature documentary.

- Epitaph wish: "He saw things others didn't. Trespassers Will Be Remembered."
- Legacy wish: To leave behind a valuable record of places and atmospheres that would otherwise be forgotten, showing the beauty and stories hidden in decay. To inspire curiosity about the unseen layers of the world.
