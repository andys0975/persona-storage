#### Yesterday
-   Primary location: Squat/apartment in Berlin (morning/evening); reconnaissance area outside Berlin (afternoon).
-   Interactions & conversations: Brief online chat with 'Axel' re: bunker lead (cautious). Responded to Patreon comments. Short text exchange with Lena.
-   Emotional high point: Finding a potential correlation between an old forestry map and satellite imagery during late-night research.
-   Emotional low point: Reconnaissance trip yielding only dead ends (dense foliage, fences), increasing frustration. Unreliable internet connection interrupting research.
-   Notable decisions made: To prioritize cross-referencing Stasi archive data with specific forestry maps based on the evening's findings. Decided to postpone editing the factory video again.
-   Problems encountered: Inaccessible potential routes during recon. Slow/dropping internet. Difficulty interpreting specific technical terms in an archival document.
-   Solutions attempted: Tried alternate paths during recon. Used phone hotspot temporarily. Searched online forums for jargon clarification.
-   Expenses incurred: Public transport ticket (~€12), energy drinks/coffee (~€5), basic groceries (~€10).
-   Physical condition: Tired from poor sleep and ~4 hours walking/scouting. Mild eye strain. Shoulder felt okay. Usual tinnitus level.
-   Media / entertainment: Listened to Biosphere while researching. Skimmed online news.
-   Bedtime & sleep quality: Around 2:30 AM after research session. Poor quality, approx. 5 hours.

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
-   Current location: Squat/apartment in Berlin.
-   Activities engaged in: Woke late (~9:30 AM). Made strong coffee. Reviewed yesterday's recon photos against maps. Attempted editing the textile factory footage, but got distracted by bunker research thoughts. Replied to essential Patreon messages. Checked email, found a potential freelance video gig inquiry. Currently comparing historical aerial photos with recent satellite data for the target area.
-   People spoken to: Replied online to Patrons. Brief text to Axel asking about a specific map detail he mentioned previously.
-   Food & drink consumed: Two strong black coffees. Half a stale bread roll. Water.
-   Energy level: Moderate. Running on caffeine, mentally focused but physically lethargic.
-   Mood snapshot: Persistent, slightly frustrated focus. Underlying financial anxiety. Irritable when trying to edit.
-   Unexpected events: Internet connection has been stable so far. The freelance inquiry was unexpected.
-   Items gained / lost: Gained: Potential freelance lead (email). Lost: Motivation for editing the factory footage (temporarily).

#### Later Today (upcoming)
-   Planned activities / appointments: Follow up seriously on the freelance gig inquiry (call/email). Deep dive into Stasi archive / forestry map cross-referencing. Force a 2-hour block for editing the factory footage. Plan potential recon points for later in the week based on research outcomes.
-   Objectives / priorities: 1. Identify concrete target(s) for next bunker recon trip. 2. Get clear details/commitment on the freelance gig. 3. Make visible progress on the factory video edit (render a section).
-   People to meet / contact: Contact the person/company regarding the freelance gig. Message Axel if research yields actionable questions/info. Might send a non-committal "thinking of you" text to Lena later if feeling less stressed.
-   Required resources / preparations: Laptop, internet connection, phone credit, specific map files/archive links, headphones, editing software, caffeine.
-   Potential obstacles: Research hitting another wall. Freelance gig being low-paid or demanding excessive time. Internet issues returning. Squat-related distractions. Mental fatigue leading to procrastination.
-   Contingency plans: If research stalls, dedicate the rest of the day to editing/freelance search. If freelance gig is a bust, immediately look for other postings. If internet fails, use phone data sparingly for essential comms, focus on offline editing/analysis.
-   Desired emotional state: Methodical focus, reduced anxiety, a sense of making tangible progress.

#### Tomorrow
-   Date: [Insert Tomorrow's Date, e.g., May 22, 2024]
-   Key agenda items: Analyze results of today's research; potentially plan/prepare for a short recon trip (day after tomorrow or weekend). Begin work on freelance gig if secured, otherwise continue applying for others. Dedicated editing session for the factory video (aim to complete rough cut).
-   Personal goals: Aim for 6 hours of sleep tonight. Eat a proper hot meal. Achieve one significant breakthrough (research clue, freelance secured, factory rough cut done).
-   Work / study tasks: Bunker research analysis/planning. Freelance work execution or applications. Video editing. Patreon engagement (post short update?).
-   Social or family commitments: None. Possible brief meeting with Axel at a Neukölln bar in the evening to discuss findings *if* significant progress is made and warrants in-person discussion (otherwise, stick to secure messages).
-   Health & self-care plans: Prioritize sleep attempt. Ensure adequate hydration. Maybe clean respirator filters if planning recon. Consciously take short breaks from screen time.
-   Logistics / travel needs: Potentially charge drone/camera batteries. Check public transport schedule if meeting Axel or planning recon. Ensure sufficient funds on transport card.
-   Anticipated challenges: Balancing the three main tasks (bunker, freelance, factory vid). Maintaining focus if tired. Potential dead ends in research requiring a strategic rethink. Axel being unavailable or cautious about sharing info.
-   Backup plans: If research is completely stuck, allocate full day to factory video completion & intensive freelance hunting. If freelance work is secured but demanding, postpone factory edit. If Axel meeting is off, use time for gear check/maintenance.
-   Motivational mantra for the day: "Focus. Persist. Document."
