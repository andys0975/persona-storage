#### Yesterday
- Primary location: Home workspace/studio
- Interactions & conversations: Email exchange with the sci-fi corridor client regarding specific 'greeble' placement options. Brief comment reply on a miniature painting forum thread about pigment washes.
- Emotional high point: Successfully scratch-building a complex pipe fitting that looked convincingly weathered and scaled.
- Emotional low point: Deep frustration with achieving the desired damp, peeling paint effect on a specific wall panel; felt like hours wasted on failed attempts. Backache noticeably worse by evening.
- Notable decisions made: Decided to strip the paint off the problematic wall panel and try a different layering technique today. Committed to ordering specific fine-tipped applicator bottles needed for adhesive work.
- Problems encountered: Creative block on the peeling paint effect. Difficulty sourcing visual reference for realistic slime/mold at 1:24 scale. One of the new ultra-fine brushes started to fray prematurely.
- Solutions attempted: Experimented with salt weathering and hairspray techniques for paint chipping. Bookmarked several macro-photography blogs focusing on decay. Tried trimming the frayed brush, but with limited success.
- Expenses incurred: Online order placed for fine-tipped applicator bottles and a replacement set of ultra-fine paintbrushes.
- Physical condition: Persistent lower backache and wrist strain. Increased eye fatigue from prolonged focus through magnification. Mild sinus irritation from dust/pigments.
- Media / entertainment: Listened to Ryuichi Sakamoto film scores while working. Skimmed through technical articles on weathering pigments during a break. Watched a few scenes from Blade Runner for atmospheric reference before bed.
- Bedtime & sleep quality: Around 12:30 AM. Sleep was okay, but woke up briefly thinking about the wall panel technique.

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
- Current location: Home workspace/studio
- Activities engaged in: Stripped the paint from the failed wall panel. Began applying a new base coat and attempting the revised peeling paint technique. Sanded some newly built structural components (wearing a mask). Took a 10-minute stretching break focusing on back and wrists. Responded to the forum message received yesterday.
- People spoken to: None verbally. Exchanged one email with the client confirming the greeble placement discussed yesterday.
- Food & drink consumed: Black coffee and a piece of toast with jam earlier. Water bottle at the workbench.
- Energy level: Moderate. Initial morning focus is starting to slightly dip, feeling the need for careful pacing.
- Mood snapshot: Determined but apprehensive about the new paint technique. Slightly irritated by the dust despite precautions. Relieved the client interaction was straightforward.
- Unexpected events: Discovered a small crack in a piece of styrene intended for a key structural element, requiring repair or replacement. The new paint technique seems *slightly* more promising but still requires careful handling.
- Items gained / lost: Gained: Confirmation from the client. Lost: A small, perfectly cut piece of styrene due to the crack.

#### Later Today (upcoming)
- Planned activities / appointments: Continue working on the wall panel effect. Repair or cut a replacement styrene piece. Start assembling some of the main corridor structural elements. Research miniature LED diffusion methods online if focus on painting wanes. Take another stretching break. Prepare a simple dinner (maybe stir-fry).
- Objectives / priorities: Achieve a satisfactory peeling paint effect on the wall panel. Assemble the basic corridor structure securely. Respond to Emi's message from earlier.
- People to meet / contact: Check emails for any follow-up from the client. Send a quick message (perhaps with a photo if the paint works out) to Emi.
- Required resources / preparations: Paints (various acrylics), weathering pigments, adhesives (styrene cement, PVA), clamps, cutting mat, hobby knife, magnifier lamp, reference photos, laptop for research. Stretching reminders set.
- Potential obstacles: The paint technique might still not meet expectations. The cracked styrene piece might be difficult to replace perfectly. Eye strain or back pain could force an early stop. Distractions from online notifications.
- Contingency plans: If paint fails again, seal it and move onto structural assembly, returning to the paint tomorrow with fresh eyes. If styrene replacement is problematic, work on detailing other components. If pain increases, switch to lighter tasks like organizing paints or sketching. Temporarily turn off non-essential notifications.
- Desired emotional state: Focused immersion, patient problem-solving, a sense of accomplishment even with small steps.

#### Tomorrow
- Date: Tomorrow's Date
- Key agenda items: Finalize assembly of the main sci-fi corridor structure. Begin planning and preparing locations for LED lighting installation. Continue detailed painting and weathering on assembled sections.
- Personal goals: Maintain consistent stretching breaks (at least 3). Drink more water. Try to finish active work by 7 PM to allow for wind-down time.
- Work / study tasks: Commission work is the priority. Spend 30-45 minutes researching and ordering specific micro LEDs and fiber optics if stock is confirmed. Review 3D planning model against physical build.
- Social or family commitments: None. Possible brief message exchange with Emi or online forum participation.
- Health & self-care plans: Adhere to stretching schedule. Use eye drops proactively. Ensure good ventilation when airbrushing base coats (if planned). Maybe take a short walk outside during a longer break if weather permits.
- Logistics / travel needs: None, work from home. Need to confirm delivery estimates for recently ordered supplies.
- Anticipated challenges: Ensuring structural integrity during assembly. Accurately marking spots for tiny LED wiring. Resisting the urge to rush the weathering process. Managing dust during any further sanding.
- Backup plans: If assembly proves tricky, focus on reinforcing existing joints and prepping sub-assemblies. If LED planning is overwhelming, switch to creating more 'greeble' components. If weathering feels off, stop and re-evaluate reference materials.
- Motivational mantra for the day: "Trust the process. Details build the world."
