#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
- Top milestones / turning points: Successfully completed a detailed commission of a miniature Showa-era kissaten (coffee shop). Received positive feedback from the client.
- Key projects or tasks completed: Finished the Showa kissaten diorama, including intricate interior details and weathering. Updated online portfolio with photos.
- Major challenges faced: Sourcing historically accurate miniature furniture; achieving realistic dust and grime effects without overdoing it; managing pre-deadline anxiety.
- New relationships or contacts: Brief email exchange with a potential new client interested in a sci-fi piece. Corresponded with a fellow artist on a forum about pigment mixing.
- Health / fitness changes: Increased eye strain towards the end of the project; neglected stretching routine, leading to more persistent backache.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Received final payment for the kissaten commission. Spent a significant portion on rare miniature bricks and a new set of ultra-fine paintbrushes. Income fluctuated, typical precariousness.
- Skills practiced or learned: Refined techniques for simulating aged wood and faded signage; practiced patience dealing with frustratingly tiny components. Learned a new method for creating realistic miniature food items (coffee, toast).
- Travel or relocations: None. Spent one afternoon photographing textures in an older nearby shopping arcade for reference.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Watched a documentary series on Japanese architectural history; Listened to ambient electronic playlists (Aphex Twin, Brian Eno) while working; Read technical articles on weathering pigments.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Focused intensity, satisfaction upon completion, underlying stress about deadlines and finances, brief relief post-project.
- Lessons learned: Underestimated the time needed for tiny interior details (again). Realized the need for better ergonomic support during long painting sessions.
- Unresolved issues carried forward: Lingering financial anxiety; need to secure next commission; slight guilt over neglecting personal well-being.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
- Key projects or tasks is working on: Started a new commission: a diorama of a dilapidated, overgrown sci-fi corridor scene. Currently focusing on structural build and base painting/texturing. Researching lighting components.
- Major challenges faced: Designing convincing sci-fi 'greebles' at 1:24 scale; sourcing specific tiny LED lights and fibre optics; communicating design choices effectively to the new client via email (awkwardly). Creative block regarding a specific wall texture.
- New relationships or contacts: Ongoing email communication with the sci-fi corridor client. Brief interaction with a local hobby shop owner regarding material availability.
- Health / fitness changes: Making a conscious effort to take short stretching breaks due to persistent back/wrist pain. Using high-magnification glasses more often, causing more frequent eye fatigue. Dust allergy slightly aggravated by sanding/pigment work.
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Received deposit for the sci-fi commission. Ordered specialized miniature lighting components and various styrene sheets/profiles online. Carefully budgeting remaining funds.
- Skills practiced or learned: Experimenting with new techniques for creating realistic decay and overgrowth (moss, vines); practicing scratch-building complex shapes; refining basic 3D modelling for planning structural elements. Learning about miniature LED wiring.
- Travel or relocations: None. Planning a short walk to observe local building decay patterns this weekend.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Re-watching Blade Runner for visual reference; Listening to post-rock (Mogwai) and film scores (Ryuichi Sakamoto); Browsing macro photography blogs focused on mold and decay. Playing intricate puzzle game (e.g., 'Unpacking') during breaks.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Intense focus, frustration with creative blocks, anxiety about client satisfaction and technical challenges, satisfaction when a technique works. Alternating between immersion and stress.
- Lessons learned: The importance of detailed preliminary sketches for complex builds; need to order specialized materials well in advance. Accepting that communication with clients is a necessary (if uncomfortable) part of the job.
- People invited / accompanying: None. Prefers solitary work. Might message Emi with a progress picture.
- Personal boundaries / taboos to respect: Do not touch Work-In-Progress without explicit permission. Avoid loud noises or sudden interruptions while working. Respect the organization (chaos) of the workspace. Don't dismiss the importance of tiny details.
- Flexible time blocks: Late afternoons/early evenings sometimes used for non-deadline tasks like organizing supplies or online research, if focus wanes.
- Weekend plans: Mostly working on the commission. Possibly a quiet walk for reference photos or a visit to a model shop if a specific material is needed urgently. Maybe order takeout and watch a documentary.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
- Long-range goal(s): Aim to complete the current sci-fi commission to a high standard and secure positive client feedback/testimonial. Start preliminary research/concepting for the next potential project (personal or commission).
- Major events / travel booked: None. Might consider visiting a craft materials fair if one is happening locally and seems relevant.
- Expected milestones: Complete structural build and base painting of sci-fi diorama. Install and test lighting system. Begin detailed weathering and adding miniature foliage/overgrowth.
- Skill-building targets: Master the new water/slime effect technique she's been researching. Improve speed and efficiency with basic 3D printing for custom parts. Practice more complex miniature lighting setups.
- Savings / investment goals: Try to put aside 10% of the final commission payment into her emergency fund. Start saving specifically for a higher-quality magnifying lamp/visor.
- Equipment or resources to acquire: Needs more specific shades of weathering pigments (rust, grime). Considering purchasing that better magnifying lamp if funds allow post-commission. Needs specific fine-tipped applicator bottles.
- Relationship intentions: Schedule a quiet coffee or tea with Emi to catch up (if commission progress allows). Continue participating passively/actively in online miniature communities.
- Health benchmarks: Aim to maintain consistent stretching breaks. Schedule an eye check-up if strain persists. Ensure proper ventilation when using strong adhesives/paints.
- Seasonal or cultural celebrations: None specific Ayame actively participates in, beyond perhaps noting the changing season aesthetically (autumn colours influencing potential palettes).
- Contingency items: Have backup materials for key components (e.g., extra LEDs). Buffer time built into the end of the project schedule for unforeseen issues or client revisions. Have alternative weathering techniques in mind if one fails.
- End-of-month review date: Tentatively set for the last day of the month to assess commission progress, financial status, and plan priorities for the following month.
