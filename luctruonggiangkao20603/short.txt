#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
-   **Top milestones / turning points:** Integrated a complex procedural generation system into her current game project after weeks of struggle. Had a "charity stream" that slightly exceeded its modest goal.
-   **Key projects or tasks completed:** Finished the core logic for the procedural generation system. Refactored a significant chunk of old 'spaghetti code' in the project. Updated streaming overlays.
-   **Major challenges faced:** Significant burnout after the push to finish the proc-gen system. Encountered several unexpected, hard-to-pinpoint bugs related to the new system integration. A dip in stream viewership/donations compared to the previous month.
-   **New relationships or contacts:** Made contact with a freelance sound designer online regarding potential future collaboration after being impressed by their work on another indie game. Briefly chatted with a couple of new faces at a (rare) local Montreal dev meetup.
-   **Health / fitness changes:** Experienced increased tension headaches and wrist strain (RSI flare-up) due to long coding hours. Sleep schedule became even more erratic. Attempted VR fitness twice, then forgot about it.
-   **Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases):** Income was slightly lower than average due to fewer stream donations post-charity drive and no major game sales. Had to dip into credit for unexpected PC component failure (new SSD). Spent too much on takeout during the crunch period.
-   **Skills practiced or learned:** Deepened understanding of procedural generation algorithms (specifically Perlin noise variations and graph-based generation). Practiced debugging complex, interdependent systems. Briefly experimented with a new shader graph technique.
-   **Travel or relocations:** None.
-   **Notable media consumed (books, shows, games):** Played through a newly released indie puzzle game ("for research"). Binged a season of a dark sci-fi show (e.g., Severance rerun). Read several technical articles on Gamasutra/Game Developer.
-   **Dominant emotions / mood trend:** Mix of intense satisfaction (after finishing the proc-gen system), followed by frustration (debugging), anxiety (financials), and general fatigue/burnout. Brief moments of connection during streams.
-   **Lessons learned:** Underestimated the integration complexity of the new system. Realized she needs better strategies for managing post-crunch burnout. Reconfirmed that documentation debt is always paid with interest (in debugging time).
-   **Unresolved issues carried forward:** Several known, non-critical bugs in the game project. The underlying financial precarity. The desire to improve marketing skills remains unaddressed. Ongoing battle with procrastination on non-coding tasks.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
-   **Key projects or tasks is working on:** Focused bug-fixing on the procedural generation system and related gameplay loops. Preparing a small, polished vertical slice/demo build for potential showcase/feedback. Maintaining regular streaming schedule (3-4 times/week), including dev streams and gameplay streams. Planning next major feature set.
-   **Major challenges faced:** A particularly persistent, hard-to-reproduce bug (nicknamed 'Le Kraken'). Balancing time between focused development and the demands of streaming (community interaction, content planning). Avoiding procrastination on writing devlog updates. Dealing with a minor but annoying streaming software glitch. Imposter syndrome flaring up when looking at demo requirements.
-   **New relationships or contacts:** Continuing casual dating with the person from the dev scene (maybe 1-2 dates). Increased interaction with specific members of her Discord community who are providing good feedback. Follow-up email exchange with the sound designer.
-   **Health / fitness changes:** Trying (intermittently) to use a wrist brace and do hand stretches for RSI. Making a weak attempt to regulate sleep slightly better (e.g., aiming for sleep before 3 AM). Still high caffeine intake. Ordered groceries online to avoid defaulting entirely to takeout.
-   **Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases):** Income expected to be average/low unless a stream raid or sudden Patreon surge happens. Paying off the credit card bill for the SSD. Considering buying a new ergonomic mouse but hesitating due to cost. Usual expenses: rent, utilities, internet, food, software subscriptions.
-   **Skills practiced or learned:** Advanced debugging techniques (memory profiling, complex breakpoints). Practicing writing clearer commit messages. Experimenting with video editing for a potential demo trailer snippet. Improving stream-of-consciousness narration during dev streams.
-   **Travel or relocations:** None.
-   **Notable media consumed (books, shows, games):** Playing current popular roguelike ("to understand engagement loops"). Watching playthroughs of games with interesting procedural generation. Started reading a William Gibson novel. Listening to synthwave playlists heavily.
-   **Dominant emotions / mood trend:** Mix of focused determination (when bug-hunting goes well), intense frustration ('Le Kraken'), background anxiety (deadlines, finances), moments of warmth/connection with stream chat, occasional bursts of creative excitement about the project's potential.
-   **Lessons learned:** The last 10% of fixing bugs takes 90% of the time. Realizing that even small streaming glitches can disproportionately affect her mood/flow. Accepting that breaks are necessary, even if forced.
-   **People invited / accompanying:** Primarily interacts with online friends (Ash, Discord community). Casual dates. Cat ('Syntax Error') is a constant, silent companion.
-   **Personal boundaries / taboos to respect:** Avoids discussing specific financial details publicly. Dislikes unsolicited backseat coding/gaming unless specifically asked. Sensitive to harsh criticism disguised as "helpful feedback". Needs downtime after social interactions, even online ones. Doesn't commit to collaborations lightly. Hates corporate jargon.
-   **Flexible time blocks:** Late afternoons/early evenings are sometimes flexible before settling into main coding/streaming sessions. Weekday mornings are often lost to late wake-up times or procrastination.
-   **Weekend plans:** Likely a mix of intense coding sessions (if trying to meet demo goal), longer gameplay stream, maybe one social outing (casual date or meetup), ordering favourite poutine, and catching up on sleep/personal errands.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
-   **Long-range goal(s):** Complete and release the polished vertical slice/demo build of her current game project. Secure enough positive feedback/metrics from the demo to validate continuing development. Reach a specific Patreon $ goal to slightly ease financial pressure.
-   **Major events / travel booked:** Considering attending a larger Montreal indie game event or conference if one happens, but hasn't committed/booked yet. No other travel planned.
-   **Expected milestones:** Demo release on Itch.io or Steam (as upcoming). Devlog update detailing recent progress and demo release. Potentially starting implementation of the next major game system (e.g., combat or narrative).
-   **Skill-building targets:** Wants to improve skills in writing compelling store page descriptions and short marketing copy for the demo. Aiming to learn a specific shader technique relevant to the game's art style. Try to consistently use her Kanban board for task management.
-   **Savings / investment goals:** Ideal goal: put aside a small amount ($100-200) into her meagre emergency fund. Realistic goal: End the month without increasing credit card debt. No investment plans.
-   **Equipment or resources to acquire:** Seriously considering purchasing the ergonomic mouse. Might need to upgrade streaming microphone if current one causes more issues. Subscription renewal for core software tools.
-   **Relationship intentions:** Continue casually dating if it remains low-pressure and enjoyable. Maintain regular contact with close online friends (Ash). Make a better effort to engage with her Discord community post-demo release. Might try to attend one local dev meetup.
-   **Health benchmarks:** Aim to consistently do wrist exercises. Try to get 15-30 minutes of walking outside at least 3 times a week. Attempt (again) to establish a slightly earlier wake-up time. Monitor caffeine intake to avoid excessive jitters.
-   **Seasonal or cultural celebrations:** None specific, unless a friend has a birthday. Might incorporate autumn themes into her stream overlay/social media posts.
-   **Contingency items:** Have a backup plan if 'Le Kraken' bug significantly delays the demo release (e.g., descoping features). Have template responses ready for expected types of feedback/trolling post-demo release. Ensure project backups are robust and recent.
-   **End-of-month review date:** Probably the first few days of the *following* month, done informally by looking at finances, project progress (or lack thereof), and stream analytics, likely accompanied by coffee and existential sighing.
