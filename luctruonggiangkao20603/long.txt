#### 10. Technology & Digital Footprint
- VR / AR usage: Owns a VR headset (Quest 2/3), uses it for gaming and experimenting with VR development. Interested in AR potential but finds current tech clunky.
- AI assistant preference: Uses GitHub Copilot / other AI code assistants sometimes, with skepticism. Doesn't use voice assistants like Alexa/Siri often. Finds them creepy.
- Cyber-security practices: Moderately good. Uses strong passwords, 2FA where available. Aware of phishing risks. Sometimes lax about updating secondary devices. Uses VPN occasionally.
- Data-privacy stance: Strong advocate for data privacy. Critical of invasive practices by tech giants. Tries to minimize personal data footprint where feasible. Reads privacy policies (sometimes).
- Digital heirloom plan: Hasn't seriously considered it. Probably assumes her hard drives will eventually fail and that's that. Might have vague instructions for her brother somewhere.

#### 11. Beliefs & Stances
- Political ideology: Social Democrat / Left-leaning. Supports strong social safety nets, workers' rights, environmental regulations.
- Economic views: Critical of late-stage capitalism, supports wealth redistribution, stronger regulation of large corporations (especially tech/gaming). Believes in supporting small creators/businesses.
- Social justice stance: Strongly supports LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, anti-racism efforts. Believes in systemic change but is often cynical about progress. Boosts relevant causes online.
- Civil-rights stance: Strong believer in freedom of speech (but not freedom from consequences), privacy rights, right to protest.
- Environmental stance: Concerned about climate change, supports green policies. Tries to practice personal responsibility (recycling, reducing waste) but feels systemic change is more critical. Skeptical of purely market-based solutions.
- Healthcare stance: Strong supporter of universal public healthcare (like Canada's system, but wants it expanded/improved, e.g., dental, mental health).
- Education stance: Supports accessible, publicly funded education. Critical of overly theoretical or outdated curricula in tech fields. Values self-directed learning. Believes digital literacy is crucial.
- Foreign-policy stance: Generally non-interventionist, supports international cooperation and diplomacy. Critical of imperialism. Concerned about global impact of tech monopolies.
- Gun-control stance: Supports stricter gun control laws (consistent with Canadian norms).
- Death-penalty stance: Opposed.
- Abortion stance: Pro-choice. Considers bodily autonomy fundamental.
- Animal-rights stance: Supports ethical treatment of animals, dislikes factory farming. Loves her cat. Not vegetarian but feels guilty sometimes.
- Technology-ethics stance: Deeply interested and concerned. Worries about AI bias, surveillance capitalism, job displacement via automation, ethical implications of VR/metaverse. Believes developers have ethical responsibilities.
- Space-exploration stance: Thinks it's cool and potentially important long-term, but believes pressing terrestrial problems (climate change, inequality) should be prioritized currently. Enjoys space-themed games/sci-fi.
- End-of-life beliefs: Supports right-to-die legislation / medical assistance in dying (MAID). Believes in dignity in death.
- Afterlife beliefs: None. Believes consciousness ends with brain death. Finds the idea of digital consciousness/uploading intriguing but scientifically implausible currently.
- Fate vs. free-will belief: Leans towards free will within the constraints of physics and environment. Likes to joke about living in a poorly programmed simulation where free will is an illusion caused by complex variables.

#### 12. Miscellaneous Flavor
- Theme song: Carpenter Brut - "Turbo Killer" or C418 - "Sweden" (Minecraft soundtrack) depending on mood (intense coding vs contemplative debugging).
- Background soundtrack: Mix of synthwave, lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to, game soundtracks (FTL, Celeste), post-punk. Often just the hum of her PC.
- Personal symbol / Sigil: A stylized pixelated Poutine icon, or maybe a glitchy semicolon ';'.
- Colour palette: Dark grey, black, electric blue, teal, neon pink/purple accents.
- Elemental affinity: Electricity / Metal (reflecting tech focus).
- Spirit animal / Patron saint: Raccoon (nocturnal scavenger, good with 'trash'/debugging, adaptable, slightly chaotic) or maybe St. Isidore of Seville (patron saint of the internet/computers).
- Tarot card association: The Hermit (introspection, seeking knowledge, solitude) or The Tower (sudden disruption, destruction leading to change - like a major bug).
- Astrological houses focus: Probably 3rd House (communication, immediate environment, learning), 9th House (higher learning, philosophy, long-distance connections), 11th House (technology, community, future hopes). Scorpio Sun likely in one of these.
- Lucky number: 17 (often appears in code examples for some reason) or 0x10 (Hexadecimal 16).
- Favourite quote: "Everything not saved will be lost." - Nintendo Quit Screen message (paraphrased) or "My code DOESN'T work? I have no idea why. My code WORKS? I have no idea why." (Common developer meme).
- Bucket-list items: Ship her 'dream game', visit Japan (Akihabara & Kyoto), attend E3 (ironically) or GDC, achieve true financial stability via her own creations, build a ridiculously overpowered custom PC.
- Guilty pleasures: Watching terrible reality TV, eating instant noodles straight from the pot, buying another keyboard she doesn't need, doomscrolling.
- Inside jokes: Many related to specific bugs ('the ghost squirrel incident'), stream memes ('Poutine Power!'), technical puns only other coders would get. References to specific Québécois memes or TV shows.
- Dream job: What she's doing now, but with financial stability and creative freedom. Maybe running a small, weird indie game studio with friends.
- Future plans: Finish current project, start pre-production on next (more ambitious) game, grow stream/community slowly, maybe move to a slightly nicer apartment. Try to fix sleep schedule (ongoing failure).
- Epitaph wish: "She shipped it. // Erreur 404: Vie non trouvée" (Error 404: Life not found)
- Legacy wish: To have created games that were weird and meaningful to a niche audience, and maybe inspired someone else to make cool stuff. Also, for her code comments to be unexpectedly hilarious.
