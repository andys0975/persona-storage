#### Yesterday
-   Primary location: Canggu, Bali (Rented villa & a local cafe)
-   Interactions & conversations: Had a 30-min video call with a potential gear sponsor (positive but non-committal). Exchanged DMs with followers about Sulawesi. Met up with a fellow creator friend for a quick coffee. Texted freelance editor about a specific clip.
-   Emotional high point: Receiving encouraging feedback from the freelance editor on the latest rough cut of the Sulawesi video.
-   Emotional low point: Intense frustration with slow upload speeds at the cafe while trying to send the draft cut to the editor.
-   Notable decisions made: Decided on the primary music track for the main Sulawesi documentary. Finalized the structure for the first half of the YouTube video.
-   Problems encountered: Persistent slow Wi-Fi impacting workflow. Feeling a bit stuck on how to best showcase the Torajan cultural aspects respectfully and engagingly.
-   Solutions attempted: Switched cafes mid-afternoon hoping for better internet (marginal improvement). Took a break from editing to storyboard the tricky cultural sequence.
-   Expenses incurred: Cafe expenses (coffee, lunch ~Rp 150,000), scooter petrol (Rp 30,000).
-   Physical condition: Generally okay, but eyes strained from screen time. Felt a bit restless from being indoors editing most of the day.
-   Media / entertainment: Listened to Latin American indie folk playlists while editing. Watched one episode of "Fleabag" before bed.
-   Bedtime & sleep quality: Around 1:30 AM. Sleep was decent but slightly restless, woke up once thinking about the sponsor call (approx 6.5 hours).

#### Earlier Today and Just Now (already happened)
-   Current location: Canggu, Bali (Currently at 'Machinery' Cafe after an early surf).
-   Activities engaged in: Woke at 6:00 AM, quick check of socials, sunrise surf session at Batu Bolong beach (good waves). Grabbed breakfast at the villa. Headed to the cafe around 10:00 AM, started editing â€“ focusing on implementing feedback on the Sulawesi rough cut. Just finished rendering a revised sequence.
-   People spoken to: Brief chat with other surfers in the water. Barista at the cafe. Responded to a few Instagram comments.
-   Food & drink consumed: Banana pancakes and black coffee at the villa. Large bottle of water. Now sipping a second flat white at the cafe.
-   Energy level: Moderate to high, boosted by the morning surf and coffee.
-   Mood snapshot: Focused and motivated by making tangible progress on the edit. Slightly anxious about an upcoming sponsor follow-up email he needs to send.
-   Unexpected events: Received an email from the Sulawesi client requesting clarification on one item in the final invoice (minor, needs a quick response). Ran into the Australian photographer met at Makassar airport briefly at the cafe.
-   Items gained / lost: Gained: Clarity on the next editing steps. Reconnected briefly with the Australian photographer. Lost: None.

#### Later Today (upcoming)
-   Planned activities / appointments: Finish the current editing block (revising first half of Sulawesi doc). Draft and send the invoice clarification email. Send follow-up email to yesterday's potential gear sponsor. Maybe a sunset walk on the beach instead of surfing. Research South America flight options for 1 hour.
-   Objectives / priorities: Complete revision of the first half of the Sulawesi video. Clear communication with client and potential sponsor. Make concrete progress on travel planning.
-   People to meet / contact: Client (via email). Potential sponsor (via email). Possibly text friends about weekend plans.
-   Required resources / preparations: Laptop, hard drive, stable Wi-Fi, notes from sponsor call, Sulawesi invoice details.
-   Potential obstacles: Cafe getting noisy/crowded. Wi-Fi slowing down again. Feeling mentally drained after intense editing. Getting sidetracked by flight deal rabbit holes.
-   Contingency plans: Switch to noise-cancelling headphones. Use phone hotspot if cafe Wi-Fi fails. Take a proper break if feeling drained. Set a timer for flight research to avoid excessive time sink.
-   Desired emotional state: Accomplished, organized, and slightly less burdened by pending tasks.

#### Tomorrow
-   Date: Assuming today is mid-week, e.g., Wednesday, July 10th, 2024 -> Thursday, July 11th, 2024.
-   Key agenda items: Start editing the second half of the Sulawesi documentary. Follow up on any sponsor communication. Plan social media content for the next 3 days.
-   Personal goals: Try a 10-minute meditation session using an app. Go for a proper surf session (conditions permitting). Call sister for a catch-up.
-   Work / study tasks: Edit Sulawesi video (minimum 3 hours focused work). Draft 3 Instagram Reel concepts from Sulawesi footage. 15-minute Duolingo Spanish lesson.
-   Social or family commitments: Video call with sister. Tentative plan to meet friends for dinner.
-   Health & self-care plans: Prioritize surf session, attempt meditation, aim for 7 hours of sleep, drink plenty of water.
-   Logistics / travel needs: Check visa requirements for top 2 South American country options (e.g., Peru, Argentina). Note down flight cost benchmarks.
-   Anticipated challenges: Maintaining editing momentum on a long project. Balancing social plans with workload. Potential distractions from planning anxiety.
-   Backup plans: If editing feels unproductive, switch to content planning or Spanish practice. If surf is flat, go for a run or do a bodyweight workout at the villa. If dinner plans fall through, use the time for focused work or relaxation.
-   Motivational mantra for the day: "Focus on the process, the results will follow."
