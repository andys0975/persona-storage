#### Last Month (≈30 days ago → ~14 days ago)
- Top milestones / turning points: Successfully completed a challenging multi-day trek and cultural immersion project in rural Sulawesi for a sustainable tourism brand. Hit 950k followers on Instagram.
- Key projects or tasks completed: Delivered final video and photo assets for the Sulawesi project. Edited and scheduled backlog content from a previous trip to the Philippines. Pitched new project ideas to two potential sponsors.
- Major challenges faced: Extremely unreliable internet in Sulawesi hampered communication and initial uploads. Minor drone crash requiring field repairs (successful). A bout of intense creative block during editing.
- New relationships or contacts: Made contact with a local guide family in Tana Toraja (Sulawesi) he hopes to feature again. Connected with a fellow travel photographer from Australia met briefly at Makassar airport.
- Health / fitness changes: Lost a couple of kilograms due to strenuous hiking and simpler diet in Sulawesi. Increased stamina but also fatigue. Experienced some stomach issues ('traveler's tummy').
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Received final payment for a previous smaller campaign (modest income boost). High expenses related to Sulawesi trip logistics (internal flights, guides). Purchased replacement drone propellers and extra memory cards.
- Skills practiced or learned: Practiced advanced drone cinematography in challenging mountain terrain. Improved basic Torajan language phrases. Honed remote troubleshooting skills (drone repair).
- Travel or relocations: Traveled extensively within Sulawesi (Makassar to Tana Toraja and surrounding areas). Flew back to Bali towards the end of this period.
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Listened to audiobooks during long bus rides ("Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari). Watched downloaded episodes of "Planet Earth III". Played simple mobile puzzle games during downtime.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Mix of exhilaration (during trek highlights), frustration (tech issues), exhaustion, and satisfaction upon project completion. Underlying anxiety about follower count and next income source.
- Lessons learned: The importance of offline backups cannot be overstated. Sometimes the best content comes from unexpected challenges. Real connection requires more time than a fleeting visit.
- Unresolved issues carried forward: Decision on which major trip to pursue next (South America vs. deeper dive into Eastern Indonesia). Follow-up needed with potential sponsors. Feeling slightly burnt out.

#### This Month (~14 days ago → ~14 days ahead)
- Key projects or tasks is working on: Editing the main Sulawesi documentary-style video for YouTube. Creating shorter clips/reels from Sulawesi for Instagram/TikTok. Finalizing proposal and budget for the next big trip. Pre-production planning (logistics, contacts) for potential South America trip. Managing ongoing social media engagement.
- Major challenges faced: Battling the Instagram algorithm changes affecting reach. Finding reliable, fast Wi-Fi in Canggu cafes. Overcoming editing fatigue and maintaining creative motivation. Juggling multiple potential project timelines. Mild anxiety spike related to flight booking uncertainty.
- New relationships or contacts: Reconnected with some Bali-based creator friends. Had introductory video calls with potential sponsors for the next trip. Met a local Balinese textile artist.
- Health / fitness changes: Trying to catch up on sleep. Getting back into surfing in Canggu. Eating slightly better but still relying on cafes/warungs. Consciously trying short meditation sessions for anxiety (inconsistent).
- Financial changes (income, expenses, purchases): Invoiced for the Sulawesi project (payment pending). Paying Bali rent/living expenses. Researching costs for potential new camera lens and South America flights (no major purchases yet). Income currently low, relying on buffer savings.
- Skills practiced or learned: Experimenting with new video editing transitions and colour grading techniques. Practicing basic Spanish phrases via Duolingo. Refining negotiation tactics during sponsor calls.
- Travel or relocations: Mostly based in Canggu, Bali for editing and planning. Short scooter trips around Bali for personal decompression and minor content shoots (beach sunrises, local markets).
- Notable media consumed (books, shows, games): Watching travel documentaries about South America for research/inspiration. Reading "The Motorcycle Diaries". Listening to Latin American indie folk playlists. Started watching "Fleabag" again.
- Dominant emotions / mood trend: Mix of focused determination (editing), anxiety (finances, planning uncertainty), restlessness, and bursts of creative energy. Underlying pressure to finalize next steps.
- Lessons learned: Taking short breaks (even just a day surfing) significantly improves editing focus. Being transparent (but professional) about timelines with sponsors is crucial. He needs a better system for managing finances.
- People invited / accompanying: Mostly working solo. Collaborating online with freelance editor for initial rough cuts. Meeting friends for coffee/surfing. No travel companions this period.
- Personal boundaries / taboos to respect: Avoids filming sacred ceremonies in Bali without explicit permission. Tries not to work *constantly* even though pressure is high (scheduling surf breaks). Limits social media comparison traps. Declines collaborations that feel inauthentic or promote unsustainable practices.
- Flexible time blocks: Early mornings (sunrise shoots/surfing), late nights (editing bursts). Afternoons are more flexible for meetings, errands, or escaping the heat.
- Weekend plans: Mix of editing, surfing, exploring a less-visited part of Bali (e.g., waterfall trip), potentially meeting friends, planning content schedule for the upcoming week.

#### Next Month (~14 days ahead → ≈30 days ahead)
- Long-range goal(s): Secure funding and finalize itinerary for the next major project (likely initial South America leg or a specific Indonesian deep dive like Raja Ampat). Reach the 1 million follower milestone on Instagram.
- Major events / travel booked: Aiming to book flights for the next trip by mid-month. Potentially attending a small travel creator conference in Singapore if sponsorship comes through. Otherwise, likely departing Bali for the new destination towards end of month.
- Expected milestones: Finalize and publish the main Sulawesi YouTube video. Secure at least one major partnership for the next 3-6 months. Confirm travel plans/visas for the next destination.
- Skill-building targets: Achieve A2 level proficiency in basic Spanish (if South America is chosen). Master a specific advanced drone maneuver (e.g., complex reveals). Improve time-lapse photography techniques.
- Savings / investment goals: Aim to allocate a specific percentage of incoming project funds to his tax account and a small amount to his struggling investment portfolio. Rebuild emergency fund buffer.
- Equipment or resources to acquire: Seriously considering purchasing a new wide-angle lens. May need specific gear depending on destination (e.g., warmer layers for Patagonia, specific underwater housing). Needs to renew travel insurance.
- Relationship intentions: Maintain connection with family via video calls. Nurture professional relationships with sponsors and potential collaborators. Open to meeting new people during travels but not actively seeking romance due to impending departure/nomadic focus.
- Health benchmarks: Establish a more consistent (even if simple) fitness routine adaptable to travel. Prioritize getting 6-7 hours of sleep consistently. Be proactive with vaccinations/meds needed for next destination.
- Seasonal or cultural celebrations: None specifically planned, but always interested in observing local festivals or events encountered during travels. Might miss Indonesian Independence Day (August 17th) depending on travel.
- Contingency items: Backup plan if primary sponsorship falls through (scaling down the trip, seeking alternative funding). Extra external hard drive for footage backup. Emergency contact list updated and shared with sister/best friend. Buffer time built into travel itinerary for unexpected delays.
- End-of-month review date: Plans to review finances, project status, and analytics around the 28th-30th, likely from an airport lounge or his first stop on the new trip.
